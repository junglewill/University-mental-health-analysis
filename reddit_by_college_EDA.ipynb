       "'\"Quit tormenting me\" what a melodramic babyThat is bad at teaching. You can give guidance without giving the answer away. A good teacher knows how to ask a good enough question back to the student to get them to answer the question themselves.\\n\\nA bad teacher won\\'t give an answer. An okay teacher will give the answer. A great teacher will teach you how to get to the answer yourself (which is way more beneficial).From my perspective of a Chinese student, I really agree with you. If the OP can understand how hard and competitive it is to get into a top-notch colleges in China, he can understand why there are so many Chinese students in America.\\nThe only goalkeeper for colleges in China is the exam at the end of the high school. If you get a decent grade, then you can get into a decent college. If you fuck up, you can\\'t. That\\'s also why there\\'re more and more international schools in China. I\\'m really sure that most parents of middle/upper class  families in China are more willing to send their kids to receive higher education in a country like America, Britain, Australia, etc. And a degree in America will definitely help us a lot in the future career no matter where we choose to live. Moreover, UIUC does have a relatively high acceptance rate for Chinese students(probably because of the historical relationship between UIUC and China).nerdDoing this right now, these classes both aren\\'t that bad. The CS 173 and MATH 347 combo could be pretty neat too, because the first exam in MATH 347 is basically most of CS 173, so if you get a good grade on that it will help for the future CS 173 chapters.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI would be more worried about CS 126 tbh, my CS classes are currently the ones keeping me really busy/stressed.Was in an email titled safety notice.

The CS department will be enforcing prerequisites from Spring 2019 for various classes, including CS 225. Students without CS 125/ECE 220 and CS 173/MATH 213 will be dropped from the course.\\n\\nBesides that, CS majors should take CS 126 before CS 225. CS 225 has been reducing the amount of C++ content, as it assumes students have learnt the necessary material in CS 126. CS 126 will also give you programming experience that will help a lot in CS 225.FKAMS Ok, I know I\\'ve given this little pep-talk two times already, but I\\'m going to give it again (and I\\'m sure there are at least a couple more situations for this to come).\\n\\nThe game was bad.  This team is not bad.  This team is building.  Illinois football was **that** bad when the current staff took over.  This team has some good and really good young players.  This team does not have veteran talent and does not have a single game-breaker.  \\n\\nThis Purdue team reminds me, in some ways, of the 2008 Illini Rose Bowl team.  Good and really good players with a couple of great players and a handful of game-breakers.  Rondale Moore is a GB for Purdue and he alone can break a game wide open.  Having him on the field just changing everything.  This was Arrelious Benn for Illinois, he didn\\'t always have the most catches, yards or TDs in a game, but his being on the field changed the game.  \\n\\nIllinois will have some great players coming in next year.  Isiah Williams has the potential to be a great player next year, and maybe even be that GB for Illinois.  The defense has hit a wall this year, after seeing amazing growth last year.  This program is still building its culture.  As a fan, it is not worth looking at the score with the remaining games.  It will be important to watch individual moments, or parts of the D or O (such as, that D-line, what changes can they make between now and NU to show some sort of progress being made).  Since last year I\\'ve said this team is an 8 win team in 2019.  At this moment, I\\'ll stand by that.  Can confirm.

If your **first** major is **not** Engineering CS, then it is possible, although hard, to add Engineering CS as your **second** major. A friend of mine a few years back, who was majoring in Bioengineering, was able to add the second major of Engineering CS. Again, this is very difficult and you must have the grades to show. You also have to petition the college for this, an additional process than just simply applying to transfer into it. My friend did this successfully, but this was a few years back.\\n\\nDespite everything I’ve said, I still say: please go talk to Steve or another CS advisor in Siebel.

[deleted]To date, I have taken 0 courses on algorithms, and a handful of \"Hello World\"-type courses over my years as a nerd. I have basically no idea how to look at a reasonably complex algorithm and get the O(f(n)) runtime, outside of an un-educated guesstimate. \\n\\nI do not claim to know Math that I haven\\'t been taught, besides a handful of things I\\'ve taught myself piecemeal. Hell, I barely claim to know a decent portion of the Math that I\\'ve been taught thus far.\\n\\nSo, yes, I missed that an algorithm from a paper that I can\\'t read was projecting something-or-other to a concept I\\'ve literally never heard of. No idea what a regret space is, unless it\\'s just continuing the grand Mathematical tradition of claiming that everything exists in some kind of n-space, in order to turn everything into a geometry. I have no problem with doing that, but it does obfuscate things for the kinds of people who haven\\'t gone through seven years of a PhD.\\n\\nI have never been good at optimization. I can\\'t look at a program and shave a few seconds off of the runtime.\\n\\nBut, I can get shit to work. I am a jury-rigger before I am a perfectionist. Look at something like NEAT, or genetic algorithms in general. When taking the fitness of each organism in a generation, in order to actually get the number of kids each organism has, the fitness has to be mapped to strictly positive numbers, or else someone\\'s gonna try to have -2 children. But I wanted to use fitness functions that could be either positive or negative, so a mapping like f\\'(o) = -1/f(0) wouldn\\'t cut it. So, I went with softmaxing the fitness of each organism, because the exponential curve constitutes a mapping of all reals to positive numbers, preserving some notion of f(a) &gt; f(b) | a &gt; b. But this allows individually dominant organisms to run away with it, which decreases diversity. So I realized you could stave off this growth by multiplying each fitness by a constant between 0 and 1, which decreases low fitnesses by less than it decreases large fitnesses.\\n\\nAm I the next Hilbert? No. Euler? No. Gauss? No. Tao? No. Liebniz? No. Newton? No. Von Neumann? No. Simons? No. Chern? No. Mirzahkani? No. Lovelace? No. Hypatia? No. Euclid? No.\\n\\nBut, I can look at problems I haven\\'t seen before, teach myself concepts off the internet or out of a book, and get shit to work. Mix and matching different shit from different fields. Let\\'s say I wanted to visualize the relative position of higher dimensional points. Here\\'s the idea; I\\'ll get the list of Euclidean distances between each pair of points in R^n, and then initialize the same number of points in R^2 .  After that, write up a loss function based on the difference between the distances between analogous points in the two different dimensional spaces, taking the positions of the points as inputs. Find the derivative of loss with respect to the relative positions of each point, and then do gradient descent - a technique I picked up while learning about Machine Learning.\\n\\nSo, to conclude; in the grand scheme of things, I know basically nothing, except two things. One, how to teach myself things, and two, how to synthesize what I know into new stuff. Happy?This will end poorly Still off topic. You wanted to prove that you know what you\\'re doing and the established way to do things is wrong because it doesn\\'t cater to you. So prove it. Or realize that you\\'re not that special and the world doesn\\'t need to change to accommodate you; you need to change to accommodate the world.\\n\\nI hope you also know that genetic algorithms are the poorest performing 0th order optimization algorithms. That\\'s why it took oh I don\\'t know 4 billion years of evolution to get to here and humans are still dumb and shortsighted.Call a Uber in advance, they will be able to wait you outside Gregory.

Yes, you will see more Illini swag, and the games have quite a few fans, but it is *significantly* more toned down than any other big ten school I\\'ve visited. \\n\\nI 100% agree with OP\\'s sentiment. Maybe it\\'s because the vast majority of students are either Illinois natives (and thus jaded) or international students. I\\'d like to say it\\'s just because our FB team isn\\'t as hot lately, but I was at U of I in 2011 when we were 6-0, and Block I STILL wasn\\'t even close to full.

This past fall, I have been lucky enough to do recruiting on the behalf of my firm. We went to about a dozen different schools. At each school, we get maybe 75-100 applicants.

Instead, I feel most have the technical chops to do what I do everyday. So, how do you narrow the pool from a few hundred to a few? Side projects and previous work experience. Especially since the rest of the pool has pretty much the same coursework.\\n\\nObviously, this is not true for all firms, but if someone has a dream job in mind, it helps to differentiate themselves significantly.

After all, remove *all* the international students from campus and you still have a decent ~33k, so what gives? \\n\\nCompare UIUC to some other highly spirited schools: Wisconsin, OSU, Michigan for instance. They\\'re all located at or very close to the major metropolitan/suburban areas of the state, and kids grow up in the families of school alumni who continue to identify with the school, go to games, wear colors, etc. Compare that to Illinois, which is located ~3 hours from Chicago and pretty far from just about everything. The majority of students here are from Chicagoland and they\\'re more likely to identify as Cubs/Bulls/etc. fans or being from Chicago compared to being an Illini fan or Illinois kid. Location doesn\\'t explain the popularity and spirit of every B1G school (PSU comes to mind), but it does for some. The people filling Camp Randle, the Shoe, the Big House are *not* students, they are primarily alumni and even non-alumni adults who continue to identify with the school. But it\\'s hard to make the weekly 3 hour trip down from Chicago to attend a game at Memorial Stadium - hence, a much smaller and still empty-feeling stadium.How did you end up being a class short?

When I was an undergrad, my father refused to do his taxes because my father didn\\'t want his children to file the FAFSA. **Dead serious.** My father thought that FAFSA was a federal government conspiracy to have college students\\' parents sign-up for high interest loans. My father was a tinfoil hat conspiracy guy.\\n\\nI had to attend community college, until I was old enough to file the FAFSA without my parents. Luckily for me, my father became very ill and my mother secretly filed the back taxes. I was able to apply for the first time, when I was 23. I had no school options except community college and working full-time in retail, until I was 23.\\n\\nI\\'m lucky that I had a community college as an option.\\n\\nIt sucks when institutional aid, like school scholarships, requires FAFSA to be completed, because some of us on the fringes are ineligible for reasons beyond our control.\\n\\nI hope that things get better for you sooner.

I\\'m sorry.\\n\\nHopefully, where we weren\\'t so lucky in life, we can help others not be screwed like us.\\n\\nDid you know that you can now file the FAFSA based on your previous financial information, assuming that nothing drastic changed, and you can amend it later?

It\\'s very similar to other language classes- class 4-5 days a week at the 100 level, daily homework (around an hour a night), tests every 2 weeks, and an oral exam or 2 a semester. I took it for 2 years- it goes a bit slower than other languages since you have to learn a new alphabet and the grammar structure is totally different from English. I highly recommend taking the courses- teaching yourself Russian is incredibly hard. But be warned, it\\'s one of the hardest languages to learn because of its grammar. It takes a lot of extra studying if you really want to learn it- I recommend an extra 30 minutes to an hour a night of studying what you learned in class. But, as long as you stay interested and really want to learn it, you should get an A with decent effort.

Some (that are mostly located in small towns) are also used to call the volunteer fire department to go fight a fire. Initially designed to warn city dwellers of air raids in World War II, they were adapted to warn of nuclear attack and of natural  destructive weather patterns such as tornadoes. The generalized nature of the siren led to many of them being replaced with more specialized warnings, such as the Emergency Alert System.\\n\\n***\\n\\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/UIUC/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28It’s funny how many people snipe back with “well cyclists shouldn’t do x” as though that is a precondition to they themselves doing the right thing.

In fintech you don\\'t need to know the finance, and you probably won\\'t learn the specific finance knowledge required for your role in finance/econ classes. There is a lot to know about how banks work, and the knowledge that relates to your job function WILL be taught to you. The more technical your degree, the better, because fintech companies want to see you\\'re smart and can learn the finance stuff quickly. They don\\'t care about you having the finance/econ knowledge, because most likely they will still need to teach it to you as the knowledge you have is not specific enough for the job role. CS + Stats will also indicate to your employer you have the aptitude to work with a lot of data, which is huge for fintech because finance companies have a LOT of data that they work with (credit card transactions for every person that uses their card, stock market data, etc...).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCS + Stats is better.

Imagine that you knew calc 2 front and back but your AP courses were lost or denied, and so you were forced to take Calc I. Now imagine that during this you become aware of complex analysis, and you\\'re like \"hey that\\'s cool\" so you ask the instructor a question asking something like \"is it possible to have a function whose Taylor series converges but doesn\\'t equal the function itself?\" (If you\\'re working in the reals then yes, like e^-x^-2 - but if you\\'re working in the complex numbers it\\'s impossible.)

You would be understandably not be very happy. \\n\\nBesides, at this point in the course there aren\\'t enough people who have clarifying questions that my purely-for-curiosity questions waste time. If half of the class were spent answering questions, then I wouldn\\'t bother asking, and I\\'d also encourage other people to take their questions to the forum so as to also not take up time. However the amount of time spent answering questions is not that high at this point in the course, so no one\\'s time is wasted by one or two additional questions. (Never mind that your mentioning of \"wasting someone else\\'s time\" is an appeal to emotion and therefore logical fallacy.)\\n\\nI\\'m in CS 125 because everyone at SAIL told me not to test out of it.

I get a lot of personally sensitive information sent to my email (e.g. bank statements, other password recoveries, etc.), so yes, 2FA for my email is about the only thing that makes sense to me.\\n\\nSimilarly, [my.illinois.edu](https://my.illinois.edu) does not require 2FA yet either, and all my personal info obtained therein and/or the ability to hack into my account and drop me from all my classes is much more important to me than being able to use EBSCO-host It\\'s so sad.Technically, that is something to do before you die[deleted]Derivative of a multivalued function need not be a multivalued function. d/dz log(z) = 1/z. log(z) is multivalued, 1/z is not.

I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they scrap MCS-DS in the future and just move everybody to MCS.\\n\\nIn fact the new MCS program already absorbed an older, identically named degree offering from before they started offering degrees in combination with Coursera.You can see my comment here about the 233 Honors Section: https://reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/9m252c/_/e7boqu5/?context=1This is true art[removed]I\\'m surprised that the course staff\\'s skin was so thin they removed the post.

Makes herd immunity all that more important though. ding dong u r wrongSpeaking from a research perspective (and primarily STEM, noting that a large number of International students in the US are in STEM), US universities in general are way ahead of other countries in terms of:\\n\\n* Research funding\\n* Research infrastructure (labs, journal subscriptions, technical resources, etc.)\\n* Output (publications)\\n\\nThis is what attracts smart people from across the world to pursue STEM research in the US. Not to say there aren\\'t any other good universities outside the US (there are), but in terms of absolute number of globally-recognized research universities in any one country, the US leads the world by a big margin. \\n\\n&gt; the USA has more freedom of thoughts \\n\\nFrankly, in STEM, I haven\\'t heard from anybody who thinks this is a motivating factor. For one, this isn\\'t 1945, and most of the world\\'s people live in democratic countries now (yes, even with that one gigantic exception). Most of those countries might be poor with a low standard of living, but freedom of thought isn\\'t really a concern. Also, in STEM, we mostly don\\'t discuss politically-sensitive topics professionally, and when it comes to writing math equations and seeing things under a microscope, you can legally do that virtually anywhere in the world.\\n\\n&gt; Wouldn\\'t it be easier to stay in your home country and attend a university there? \\n\\nIf it\\'s a question of attending *any* university for the sake of a piece of paper called a degree, then yes, it would be easier. Much, much easier in every way imaginable (financial, personal, professional, *not having to deal with CBP*, etc.). But in terms of attending a *good* university, nay, a *top* university, then it is not easy. It takes years of sacrifice in high school, slogging away over a book (forget about sports, entertainment, relationships, etc.), and competing with millions of equally smart and hard-working people to get into a few thousand positions. It\\'s simple supply-demand: there are more people and fewer good universities, which makes it highly competitive.\\n\\nSome of the best universities in China and India have an undergraduate acceptance rate that would put Harvard and Stanford to shame (think less than 1%), and don\\'t even get me started on the acceptance rates at public universities like this one. The kind of competition there can be brutal - and by brutal, I mean a lot of kids committing suicide because they can\\'t take it. Compared to that, the US has far more opportunities and even relatively small public universities are pretty good. Not to say that US students have it easy, but frankly, the magnitude of the problem is different by *orders of magnitude*. Pm meI don\\'t look down on money.  I just don\\'t find \"seven figures\" (or fear of disaster) to be a compelling motivation for anything.[RIP your personal data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing).Ece/cs department makes registration shitter than it already is...why am I not surprised.What a fucking idiot... dude is ECE too lmao.The pianos that are used in Foellinger Great Hall.

You may be pushed back a semester, but it\\'s better to try your best now, do the work, and learn (plus then you\\'ll be able to use parts of your own code the next time so it\\'s easier to finish).

College life is a lifestyle that pretty much cannot be replicated elsewhere. It’s an entirely different way of living. People also look back with rose colored glasses.

Those bikes are hella ass m8Im the grader for math 347H and 416 (not 416H) this semester. Heres the link to the class: [https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/\\\\~lerman/347/f18/347f18hw.html](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~lerman/347/f18/347f18hw.html). This semester 347H is doing   a mixture of set theory, real analysis, and abstract algebra (ring theory). The professor for the class put lecture notes, homework problems, and solutions on the website. You can take a look to see whats going on in the class right now (Keep in mind that 347H varies each year , so they cover different stuff).\\n\\nFor Math 416, heres the link: [https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/\\\\~nevins/courses/aut18/416-summaries.html](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~nevins/courses/aut18/416-summaries.html). I would say that this section of math 416 is more challenging than other sections since the professor asks to do a lot of proofs. Overall, if you are eager to learn mathematics and appreciate the theory of mathematics, then you should be ok taking both.&gt; unless it\\'s possible to get into some other major in the College of Engineering and then transfer\\n\\n\\nWell yeah that was my comment lol. If you want CS+X transfer into an easy LAS major. If you want CS ENG, transfer into like IE or something easier to get into. Then do a ICT. This is obviously a pragmatic approach... not ideal. Dead memeHoly shit. So instead of getting a cut of the SORF fee under all student initiative fees where students get a say, this is university approved funneling of money into a third party to support an incredibly poor quality student newspaper.\\n\\nDefund this shit.In hindsight, I think I absolutely made the right decision in going to UIUC and finishing my bachelors in ME there. \\n\\nFor me, the anxiety/depression was more a result of being away from home and having some sort of \"existential crisis\" as I was getting older. I think it was also slightly difficult to transition from high school, where I was easily one of the top 5% of students without much effort, to UIUC where I was somewhere in the middle of the pack. It was difficult for me to handle the mental issues I was going through while also managing the coursework.\\n\\nThe coursework will be challenging, but if you\\'re willing to put the effort in and seek out help you\\'ll be fine. For some reason, it took me quite a while to realize that going to office hours and asking others for help was a smart thing to do.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, I was able to treat it pretty close to a monday-friday gig. I didn\\'t go out and party very often on the weekdays, although I occasionally did. Having said that, it was pretty much gym/lectures/homework/sleep through the week.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you totally disregard everything above, the most important thing I could say is to give engineering a try initially - if you don\\'t like it after a year it will be super easy to transfer out to something else.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI would be happy to talk with you about any other questions/concerns you have homie.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;Hey!

First: Do not panic until you see your actual scores and the actual grade distribution.\\n\\nSecond: Look at the grade distributions and scatterplots on last semester’s web page https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/sp2018/A/ (I was the instructor.) The correlation between midterm 1 and midterm 2 grades is _incredibly_ weak. One student got a D on midterm 1 and an A on midterm 2; another student was exactly the opposite. Differences of a full letter grade, in either direction, are extremely common. The material covered on the two midterms exercises very different skills, and many students find one section of the course significantly easier than the other.\\n\\nEven if you did really horribly on midterm 1, it is totally possible to pull out a B in the class. Not _easy_, and probably not without changing some work/study habits, but definitely possible. But don\\'t have anything to drink in the fridge except spoiled milkI honestly just read over the slides really hard and tried to visualize it happening in my head. You could message me and I could explain how I study for the exams. I don’t bother with the readings and studied like 4 slides a day starting Friday. Each lecture I spent at least 2-3 hours on combined but not all in one day. I got a 88 on the first and 91 on the last one. Built at the same time and in similar fashion to undergrad halls. No difference.Reverse image search says the above is Glenn Howerton.

Class is important, but don’t forget to take care of yourself. Yo dm me we could do a viewing partyI was just thinking this! Maybe it is because this semester, I\\'m taking more rigorous classes, so I\\'m more stressed and am noticing it more in others, but...I haven\\'t met anyone so far this semester that has felt that school is going well right now.[deleted]Just note, a private corporation is not public transportation.idk why you\\'re asking people on the internet when you should be talking to your advisors, department, professors, etc.At Illinois, We care.Ask charles or whoever is leading city schoalrs in your department.They weren\\'t released to control *just* the squirrel population. What do you think happens to those people who you work with for a whole semester on a class and then never see them again?Because saying think about it is a lazy shitpost. There\\'s no guidance asking what characteristics it has, properties of induction and contradiction, or anything else. And this shitty attitude and laziness is rampant in math. Actually, off-campus transfers who don\\'t transfer directly into PREP when they join UIUC can never transfer to PREP. This is a new policy from the College of Engineering effective Fall 2017. Only new freshmen have the possibility of a transfer into PREP. Even students who transfer in second semester freshman year are excluded from PREP consideration.\\n\\nI agree that Math&amp;CS is a fantastic major, but usually when students say they want to come here for CS, they mean ENG CS, so it\\'s good for them to have the info up front.[deleted]what are your schedules looking like.. CompE or EE?nice usernameDude, that first guy sounds like a complete idiot.  If he was interested in politics, why wouldn\\'t he get a degree in PolySci?it\\'s primarily a math course, so it doesn\\'t really compare to 125what friendsI think the professor is just exacting revenge on the one time a tree fell on his car...bad humanfuck yeahKeep your head up and look for the nice people.  Be the change you want to see.  A lot of people act that way because it’s the only way they know how to have self-esteem.  Keep doing you and making the choices that you do and you’ll find others like you. \\n\\nJust make sure you talk to people. Make friends with them. Even the most arrogant people will have some nice sides to them. \\n\\nAlso take opportunities when you are friends with them to gently challenge their behavior when you see it fit. Toxic behavior echoes more toxic behavior, and going against the grind to be nice or show others how to live life beyond your GPA and resume can be uncomfortable but echoes too. (Just don’t overdo confrontation. Conversations are better.). Just make sure you’re doing this because you love them first. Not to befriend someone to change them. \\n\\nBut in my personal experience I have made basically only non-arrogant CS friends my whole time here.  We are mostly quiet, and you may or may not be distracted by the loud few (I don’t know, as I’m not in your cohort.)  also branch out to other majors and make friends there. You’ll meet some cool people who will change your life. Then you won’t have time for the annoying people, and they won’t affect you. \\n\\nWell, except for on Piazza. But Piazza angst comes from people whose identity is set in their grades and whose arrogance is high. They have too much worry to trust that professors want to help them succeed. They spend too much time trying to optimize their grade and not enough growing by using the resources here and learning with others. \\n\\nI want them to learn their lessons too for sure. But I’ve found that my journey in college involved doing what I love to do and shrugging off what other try-hard overly pragmatic people think about it. \\n\\nI actually don’t want to leave it just at that end note... what do you think will change the culture?

This varies **dramatically** between different departments and between degree plans.\\n\\nIn general, my experience is that the more coursework-focused a degree is the less ability you have to take courses in other departments.  Most of our professional engineering degrees (ex: MENG) usually have a very set series of courses you are required to take with little room for other courses.  On the other side, Ph.D. programs usually allow anything you and your department/committee agrees best fits your research (even if that means many courses from a different department).\\n\\nThe only answer here is to ask your adviser.Yes, Willard is actually in Savoy lolMy point is if there are indeed rules about behavior like this, op might consider reporting it.

All they’re doing is trying to prep you for how demanding your career will be and your ability to produce good work in an unreasonable amount of time. Creativity is imperative to any engineering field, but putting a time constraint on a person really limits one’s ability to gauge their creativity. I totally get how you feel. Since transferring from community college, where I was able to let myself really understand what I was learning instead of trying to memorize processes, I feel like I’ve lost my love for learning and have sacrificed my mental health just work  at the same level as the majority of my classmates(I.e. getting all the answers but not really passionate in the material being taught) . It really sucks and I get it. You’re life is worth living, because trust me, things will start to get better in time. Just realize that right now, you have control of how your semester will turn out and if you work your ass off(even if you don’t like it), by the end of it, you’ll feel so much better than you’re feeling in your current state, because you’ll know that you’ll be one step closer to getting where you want to be.

One involves complex analysis which is beyond the scope of the course but I\\'ll try to explain it anyway. The other is within the scope.\\n\\n**METHOD 1: COMPLEX ANALYSIS**\\n\\nThere\\'s a thing called a multivalued function, which is exactly what it sounds like. As you look at the value of the function along a closed loop, at the start and end of the loop it will have different values. This is possible because there\\'s a singularity (a pole at which the function is infinite) somewhere in the domain. log(x + iy) is an example. \\n\\nNow since the vector field satisfies the differential equations, that means that although it may not be conservative, it is the gradient of some function - which might be multivalued with its singularity inside the hole in the domain.\\n\\nHere\\'s the trick: Because of the way multivalued functions work, it\\'s possible to define a so-called \"branch cut.\" This is a line along which we can make the function discontinuous and it will become a single-valued function (the \"principal branch\"). So if we define the branch cut as occurring somewhere along curve A, then curves B and C are both along the principal branch and therefore have the same line integral, but curve A crosses the discontinuity and does not. Therefore the answer is 2.\\n\\n**METHOD 2: MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS THAT NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD EVER THINK TO DO**\\n\\nTrace the curves C and the reverse of B in succession. This is a closed loop. It doesn\\'t go around the hole so I can define a simply connected subdomain D\\' containing both curves. Since the vector field satisfies the differential equations, and now its domain is simply connected, it\\'s conservative on that subdomain (note that this is basically equivalent to defining the principal branch to be continuous over B and C), the integral over the unioned curve (the difference of the two integrals) is 0. Therefore the integral over B is equal to the integral over C, therefore the answer is 2.This\\\\^\\\\^.\\n\\nYou\\'ll be surprised at how painful \"simple\" logical errors can be to fix -- I know a whole bunch of different ways to do the CS 225 MPs, but I\\'ve spent far over 15 minutes figuring out with someone what they did that caused something to go wrong.  This is when I already know what the program is doing, what solution they\\'re building, and it still takes a long time.  If you can summarize it on SO, you\\'ll find that\\'s a really great community and will require you to really have a tightly-worded, compact summary (which IRL, you\\'re often just giving a stream of conscious).\\n\\nIt\\'s awesome you\\'re working on a side-project -- good luck on it and don\\'t even up (even with the memes, which I shamelessly had to add to). :)lolTI-36x Pro, for the win.

Because job prospects for engineering are better in the US? Because US universities are very well-respected and/or prestigious (sometimes to a stupid degree) in other countries?

To be honest, there is literally zero instruction on how to do anything in the class so far. GOOGLE CAN\\'T TEACH YOU EVERYTHING. I am really frustrated by how the assignment is designed. It\\'s something you can finish in few seconds, if you are familiar with the library and know some specific functions.  However, if you don\\'t know about it, you will end up spending few days , but still can\\'t figure it out. It\\'s extremely unfair for the students who don\\'t have previous experience.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf this class is about teaching good coding style, the assignment should be on something students are familiar with so that students can focus on styles, rather than bumping their heads against the wall to figure out how the stupid library works.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nPlus, the TA offers no help on Piazza.

Even if you have *no* time to actually work on something when it\\'s first released/posted/announced, read it over so that you think about it in the back of your mind, and pick up thoughts on how to accomplish it from in-class discussion.[deleted]I\\'m going to offer a perspective as a current 126 student. Thus far, it takes more effort to get C++ setup on your computer and a functioning catch2 (the testing class, think JUnit testing in Java) on your machine than it does to complete the assignments. Prof Evans is still working out the class, as in this week we had more bridge assigments that are simple in between the Java and heavier C++ stuff, just so people can figure out more things and get exposed to code. I did know C++ before, but I don\\'t think it was that significant, as there are always workarounds to some issues beginners have with C++ (such as stack/heap allocation). The Bjarne Strousup book is the recommended book, although Prof Evans did say he doesn\\'t like it because it\\'s super thick and goes through programming from the ground up, so if you just read through you\\'ll have to go over statics and encapsulation and inheritance all over again. But since 125 is your first class, that book might be a great resource (if you learn well from a book). I will say that the current iteration of 126 has 2 syntactically easy assignments in C++ right after Java (Tictactoe, something you already implemented in java, and sudoku which just requires some knowledge of recursive logic), and then the third one, Naive Bayes, is hard to grasp conceptually just from the spec, but he does a good job of explaining it in class. It\\'s also pretty straightforward syntactically. The main draw to learning some C++ syntax would be getting some practice in, and increasing the speed of your coding. That\\'s definitely useful, and doable. If you plan on studying it in earnest over break, the Bjarne Strousup book is your best bet, otherwise, just messing around in C++ will help.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAbout Visual Studio: a lot of people find visual studio to be fine, and can use it throughout 126 and 225. But in many cases, more experience coders switch to text editors, and lose the GUI components of IDEs. I learned and did C++ in VS before this class, but it still was a little strange transition to a text editor, as far as getting a compiler and setting up my computer to run C++ from cmd, but using visual studio is really good to learn how to do C++ before the class starts.

It was on time, nothing strange happening during the ride, and everything was normal.\\n\\nHowever, I still think that you should try to avoid them at all costs because of the piece of shit owner.

Worrying about assignments and due dates, applying to jobs and getting rejected all make me anxious and depressed to some extent but it\\'s something that I\\'ve gotten used to for a long time now. I enjoy watching a lot of movies and shows since they take my mind off things, but it also takes time away from homework and studying which is no bueno. I also eat and sleep well, so I take care of myself first before I take care of schoolwork. One thing that\\'s both good and bad for me at least is that time seems to be moving a lot faster now, we\\'re entering the eighth week of school and I don\\'t even remember where the last few weeks went. Biggest fears in life at the moment though, are not graduating in four years, having to do an extra semester, and not being able to find a full time EE job in the field I want, which all make me super anxious and depressed.They’re pretty good.

It’s everything to do with the fact that it’s run by a narcissistic racist who doesn’t give a rats ass about any of his customers and goes through great lengths to fuck them over. Before I learned who Dennis really was and took suburban express the buses were decent and were relatively on time, about as good as you could expect of a bus company. But the asshole that runs the company doesn’t deserve another cent. It\\'s great that you have morals and the desire to learn, but in all honesty this class isn\\'t worth the trouble you\\'re going through. Firstly, unless this is a class for your major and not a gen ed, don\\'t stress too much about whether or not you understand the material in its entirety, that effort would be better directed to classes that actually impact your major. Secondly, using Quizlet, CourseHero, Chegg, or anything of the sort isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing becasue we all need a little help from time to time and if the resources are there why not use them? Additionally, it\\'s a 100-level class and if you\\'re struggling with the material, you shouldn\\'t shy away from OH since that\\'s your best bet unless you can get someone to explain the material to you. With this being said, good luck dude. Yeah I\\'d agree with you to an extent. You should study what you have interests in. But I\\'d counter everything else, w the logic that, minors dont mean much in the real world. Then, imo, you should study stuff that benefits your major. And the majority of times, the subjects that overlap are the areas that you can legitimately have a career path in. Not subjects that have almost no overlap.We can just pick a new mascot, and if everyone accepts it, it\\'ll just be our mascot, administration or not.\\n\\nI vote for a giant, depressed ear of corn.[deleted]I\\'m not lying come asapyou must be one of the assholes who has normal group conversations on the quiet floors:/Discovering your fursona with a real furry...I’ll pray for you dude Outside of big name tech companies and Silicon Valley startups,interviewers rarely ask dynamic programming questions.I mean, I think a lot of people lock the workstation before they walk awayTo note, if I remember correctly from the whole bake sale controversy of last year, there are two republican RSOs: one that is pro-trump and one that is more moderate republican.

Stacks are Last-In First-Out (LIFO) containers, and a queues are First-In First-Out (FIFO) containers. If you study enough, then it\\'ll be fine. The lectures are sometimes convoluted. It has 3 lectures per week and a discussion. There are four labs, each 2 hours long. So like 6 hours a week on average. The material takes time to understand, since it goes against normal logic. To get an A in the class, you need to take time to digest all the concepts. Homework isn\\'t that bad, and the discussions are the most useful.\\n\\nAll in all, you should be fine.[deleted]Is that really true?

After that, I would recommend a natural shampoo and conditioner that contains a lot different oils such as argan oil.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nAlso really important, people who shampoo their hair everyday especially with products such as Head &amp; Shoulders which contain ingredients such as sulfate (which is terrible for your scalp, companies just use these ingredients because they are cheap.  They couldn\\'t give a sh*t about what happens to your scalp.) are stripping all the natural oils which your hair/scalp needs at least a little bit of, drying your scalp excessively which also causes dandruff, and also making yourself more prone to baldness.

If you\\'re out of state, well UIUC is still one of the top schools in the country for engineering, but obviously you may have been able to get a better deal with in-state tuition.

Everyone is so desperate for programmers that they will take anyone, especially if they put in tons of extra hours. \\n\\nBut to the rest of you, you really need to think about what sets you and your degree apart from those who are fresh out of high school who learned python when they were 12. If it is just a \"stupid piece of paper\" to you, chances are that you are not putting an effort in to the education you are paying for. There are many things that by pursuing a degree, you are forced to learn. People always say \"you can always google it\". Sure, you can... but will you? For example: a linked list and array list will both work perfectly fine. Would you really stop and ask \"which is better and why\" for all little things like that? Would you even know that both exist? This is something that anyone who payed attention is CS125 can answer. But I kid you not, 80% of interviewees cannot reason which is better.\\n\\nLittle things like that add up every day.

Time is definitely the limiting factor - but I\\'ve been thinking about it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve always been a math person, really (major is Math &amp; CS) and finding intuitive ways to understand both core concepts and strange results in math has always been very interesting to me - as well as helping me remember them. At some point along the way I picked up friends who took a similar approach and we would spend a lot of time sharing intuitions etc with each other, and that\\'s probably the practice I\\'ve had at explaining stuff.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve only really been coding for maybe 4 years (compared to some of the coding geniuses that come into UIUC as freshmen), but most of what I code is just little projects that I happen to be interested in at the time. I\\'ve had very little formal instruction in CS, so I figured since 125 covers the power of object-oriented programming in-depth, as well as program packages (file structure, which I know nothing about) and data structures, which I know only enough of to get by, I figured I might as well take the class and have a more solid foundation for future courses. And pretty quickly I made friends with some people who have never written code before and that made me realize I probably shouldn\\'t be avoiding the forums lol.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you\\'re really into learning more about programming, I\\'d highly recommend pulling up one of the \"playground\" slides from lecture, or making a new project in IntelliJ, and messing around with different syntax or trying to solve some basic problems like finding the biggest/smallest value in an array (or sorting arrays, or various ways to manipulate strings, building a small project with some basic objects, etc). While I\\'m sure these are things we\\'ll talk about in class, exploring under the pressure of a grade always feels like it makes errors and exceptions your enemy. In reality, you should carefully read and google every error message you get to find out what causes it, and then figure out why your code didn\\'t work the way you expected. That way you both fix the error, know how to fix it in the future, and learn something new that you need to be wary of when writing code. Also if you\\'re ever unsure how a particular interaction works, just test it! I had to do this just a few hours ago when answering a question because I wasn\\'t sure if attempting to print a null object would throw an exception or print \"null.\"Wait 8 weeks.

There\\'s a way to interpret complex analytic functions as vector fields, but it roughly amounts to saying that some quantities called the curl and divergence are zero. For conservative vector fields, the curl is zero, but not necessarily the divergence. A conservative vector field can have \"sources\" and \"sinks\", but something from complex analysis can\\'t.

This is a good issue to bring up and discuss as it seems some folks are not aware that it is an on-going remediation effort in the world. Bad levels of lead exposure is never a good thing but it has the most damaging effects in children which is why you see a lot of remediation and testing done in primary and high schools as well as in parks in the US. As mentioned elsewhere - flushing the fixture typically clears out the water which has had time to react with any lead in the pipes and fixtures. People who live in quite old buildings which have not been re-plumbed will often let the water run first thing in the morning to bring fresh water into their apartments pipes. What do you mean?

What\\'d you end up doing to make the night so special?They used to not allow any calculators at all until they added the small ones Spring 2018. They don\\'t allow personal calculators so to prevent storing materials and cheating. The professors aren\\'t fully aware of what is on each quiz because the questions are taken from a bank and are randomized for every student once you click \"generate quiz.\" While they do take time to get used to, the cbtf quizzes serve as good preparation for midterms in future classes, especially tam 251, where the questions are long and time is short. I agree with you that the system could be better, it\\'s just hard to justify grading so many quizzes multiple times a semester. In regards to fbd drawing questions, they do seem pretty finicky since you need to get within half a square for it to count, but if you do get the points for them quickly it seems like easy points afterwards. Also tam 212 and 251 implemented a sort of partial credit system where you can at least know you are on the right track, which is a step in the right direction. Overall, the cbtf quizzes are stressful, and like you said, going over past quizzes should be easier. While the system isn\\'t perfect, a pro is that graded handwritten quizzes in tam courses are extremely strict. For instance, 251\\'s first midterm was a 50% average without a curve... There is, however, a class curve in TAM classes usually so try not to stress about it too much and just give it your best effort. You must be blind. We have several new faculty, new useful classes are being added and an at least state wide advertising campaign is going on.

It’s not an inherent problem with the subreddit that the community here (like the student body) leans Democratic, it’s just a characteristic of it. Report that professor to your advisor and the college dean. Record him laughing at students’ questions (I’d recommend doing this before bringing your case forward in the event that the professor gets a tip-off). Gather other students with similar experiences. This happened to another professor in a different department who was notorious for treating students this way. After they got reported, guess who was all smiles and respect. \\n\\nYou’re paying too much money and putting in too much effort to have to put up with that shit.

The man was Hispanic, and Madigan’s district is highly Hispanic, so the man though he’d have a chance. To counter this, Madigan directed two men with Hispanic-sounding last names to also enter the race. What had been previously an uncontested race was now a 4-way race. The catch was that Madigan’s plants didn’t run campaigns. Their campaign HQs were residential addresses and no one ever saw their face.

I see many couples around campus, I know many couples who met on campus, and I believe that by being a university student you have an incredibly large amount of opportunities to go out and meet new people.

The A and B lectures this semester are actually taught pretty differently, A lecture\\'s Prof. Warnow requires you to write proofs in LateX apparently, and has midterms (which for the first one, apparently had a ridiculously high grade distributions, most people got 90-100%). Compared to that, Prof. Evans teaches B lecture this semester, on the same framework as Professor Fleck taught it previously. We have weekly examlets, which are miniature 30 minute tests. I\\'ve found that studying the night before for about an hour is sufficient to manage the work, and the Fleck book that we\\'re working out of is widely regarded in the CS program as a great textbook. I would recommend checking out the course websites, and going from there (try older semesters if the current one lacks some information: Prof. Evans sometimes does not update his site, so some links are broken, so checking out Prof. Fleck\\'s old sites gives access to old tests and the like).“Akshay Kumar”\\n\\nLike, the Indian actor dude?Well that’s troubling, ladies normally love to differentiate integrals from 0 to n Take a walk down to crystal lake park and enjoy a nice meal out\\nIf people from the 1800s time warped to the present what would they think \"highkey daddy af\" meanshttps://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/8zq8la/looking_for_tshirts_with_textures_and_patterns/He said that the answer was 2 cause the curve lied on the right side of the hole so it was simply connected there/conservativeYou can have out of state students that aren\\'t international.\\n\\nThe school receives more applications than it can accept.

The slippery slope of \"when does taking away benefits end\" doesn\\'t apply when 1. The benefit in mind was only available for less than half of the entire RA population, 2.

At best, United health care simply doesn\\'t cover the claim. and the student simply pays...at worst, somebody calls their bluff, and United Health Care says \"OK, we\\'ll fix it\", and everyone thinks \"Oh, you just had a difficult time with your insurance, that\\'s normal\"  \\n\\n\\nNo, it\\'s fucking not normal, it\\'s shit insurance.True, it could also just be a design or communication problem but maybe the professor isn\\'t that invested in being a good instructor, idk much about him.Just wait until you turn 19.

First and foremost, that would mean that MTD security would be confronted by the police for why they didn\\'t do their job, and I\\'m sure that wouldn\\'t go over well. The last thing I need is MTD security pissed off at me since I ride the bus regularly. Secondly, I was already late to meet with my mom who has cancer, and I\\'m her caregiver. I didn\\'t have time to stick around waiting for a police officer to come to the scene which can sometimes take upwards of a half hour. By that time the homeless person would have already been gone.

That is strange you had to wait!&gt; Because the truth is your life doesn\\'t mean jackshit without a degree in the real world.\\n\\nFalse. It\\'s really more of, \"Your degree doesn\\'t mean jackshit in the real world.\" College is basically just a huge form of gatekeeping. I could teach myself all of this shit (*especially* programming) and probably be way more efficient with my time than I could ever be as a student. Having a degree or not is not indicative of your skills whatsoever.

How many 2021 students were removed from DGS-PREP after the Spring 2018 semester?I don\\'t remember exactly what we covered in I, but in II we covered acid/base concepts, thermo, electrochem, and a bit of orgo and naming. I just found the concepts easier to understand and I liked it better, and I spent a lot more time studying and doing practice problems. For engineering students, I believe your chance of dropping this course at this point of time is limited since it is a restrictive course. You have to talk to your advisor about that before you do any anything. (not a meme, but actually something you need to do)\\n\\nIf your advisor let\\'s you drop, I believe you can drop 102 and keep 103, they are different classes after all. If you really want to drop both, I can recommend adding a 1 hr ice skating course (KIN 104) to round up your credit hrs to 12.\\n\\nI... feel like this is sage wisdom, but I don\\'t think I\\'m getting it?

Your goal is to improve and do better in school first and foremost, the GPA will come second. \\n\\nLogistically though, if you want to raise your GPA, you should probably retake classes and really try this time. I didn\\'t do that and was still able to raise mine quite a bit w/ slow improvement, but that will help you more than anything else. We’ve never had a part time. We do hire people for extra help during the summer months.Damn, I got excited for a moment before realizing it was just Rutgers...Where else are they?

You\\'ve got to understand that our programs are top ranked not solely because of the information that is taught in classes, but because of their rigor. The curriculum is purposely designed to push you to your limits, it\\'s flexing your mental strength to prepare you for any challenge you come across later in life. You could take these same courses online through any accredited University, but it\\'s not pushing you the same way our nationally renowned program does. There\\'s a reason why Illinois is able to attract great engineering faculty. \\n\\nThis isn\\'t me trying to get you to \"drink the kool-aid\" either, I\\'m just a few beers deep and want to reassure any of you reading this that the investment you\\'re putting in now is going to (literally and metaphorically) pay off. Any problem that you come across in the workforce will be solveable, because you will not fold to the pressure. I\\'ve maybe used 10% of what I learned in classes in my job out of school.

That feature is a priority for me personally, but other people have different preferences and may prefer different apps :)There is z displacement. There is no x and y displacement. Also, the work is the dot product between force and displacement.

There was a cheating scandal 2 years ago where people got ahold of prior midterms and those who had to take the exam early discussed the content in a group chat until some bitch ratted them out later that afternoon. I guess the department and the prof just gave up XDI agree with you about the McKinley thing. I think the main thing I could say about the one-hour sessions at McKinley is that it was nice to be able to talk to someone. Overall it was sort of a wash for me because I felt that all my counselor did was write down things I said and in later sessions ask about those things again. It was a bit cleansing to talk about issues but other than that I don\\'t know that I really learned how to handle whatever anxiety or whatever I have.Yee. This is such a freshman thing.

His father beat him, and when the boy went to work, his father would take all the earnings. He was rebuffed romantically repeatedly. Eventually, he got a wife, had four kids, two of whom he had to watch die, and then his wife went insane. Throughout his life, he displayed symptoms of clinical, suicidal depression, and often wrote about wanting to die, how much of a terrible waste of space he was, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd yet, none of those things stopped him, in the end. He did a few good things. Entered the wrestling Hall of Fame. Won some tough cases as a lawyer. Freed the slaves.\\n\\nSo, look, you might get kicked out of college. So what? It happens.

Just about anything else is better than being in the place you\\'re in now.Genetic algorithms are horribly inefficient, and yet they\\'re still beautiful, and also possess the advantage of not necessarily needing to know what succeeding would look like in order to advance, which separates it from things like gradient descent, which require having vast amounts of data to work with in order to come up with even a reasonable approximation, and also have an issue with it being difficult to determine what topology the network should use in order to be most efficient. I\\'d be willing to bet that genetic algorithms, although never being mainstream, will still be worth considering for certain kinds of design problems.yeah I\\'ve heard them play that theme consistently at noon.

CS here is great but not as amazing as people make it out to be. It’s not like every CS major here is a genius (case in point is me, and the average person really isn’t too amazing) and some courses (maybe it’s more the course structure) have some really shitty aspects. However, it’s insane how willing CA’s and TA’s are to help me in office hours (especially in 200 level courses not including 241) and professors are definitely excellent researchers (for most it doesn’t transfer to teaching).

He does a lot of favors for them, gets them jobs, funding, whatever they need. They in turn appreciate having a representative with so much power and influence. \\n\\nA few years back someone dared to run against Madigan. The man was Hispanic, and Madigan’s district is highly Hispanic, so the man though he’d have a chance. To counter this, Madigan directed two men with Hispanic-sounding last names to also enter the race. What had been previously an uncontested race was now a 4-way race. The catch was that Madigan’s plants didn’t run campaigns. Their campaign HQs were residential addresses and no one ever saw their face. It became obvious they were there to split the Hispanic vote and ensure Madigan emerged on top. That’s the kind of guy Madigan is.

You don’t have to attend any meetings, especially not MA meetings.\\n\\nGeez, MAs really letting power go to their heads.Bonjour, je suis une petite baguette, oui. my friend says he sounds a bit like mickey mouse when he gets really high pitched and talks fast ��It\\'s common, though not the majority case.Get rekt.\\n\\nIn all seriousness, consider only taking 3 of the 4 courses that you have in mind for next semester. Definitely keep ECE 220 for next semester and work hard in it since you\\'re a CompE, do all the MPs. Keep ECE 110 as well to just get it out of the way. You could delay either MATH 286 or PHYS 213/214 for next Fall and only take one of them this Spring. In my opinion delay PHYS for next Fall, but don\\'t do what some people do and leave it for senior year. Or you could just take em all if you think you could handle them, and if you see that you can\\'t in the first few weeks, then just drop one of them and add a gen ed.But they *can* open investigations and subpoena witnesses. And they can vote to impeach Supreme Court justices.of courseThat seems like the sort of warning that should be mentioned in orientation or posted somewhere.  I never knew we were supposed to let the water run 30 seconds first, and would have thought it wasteful if I had seen someone else doing it.[deleted]If only you took that midterm yesterday you sweet summer child.Former transfer here what college are you in?Ask your advisor Dude, let\\'s not kid ourselves. You and me both know that ALL, and I mean, ALL of your questions are either better left for office hours or better left not being said at all. And I notice you gave quite a tame example of a typical question. A lot of everything else you say is simply a statement of your own self-proclaimed intelligence simply phrased as a question. We KNOW you are smart. Why isn\\'t it enough for you to just be smart and not have to flaunt it? Maybe people wouldn\\'t be annoyed so much at you if you just let them discover your intelligence naturally rather than shoving it in their face. I have no doubt that the questions that you have are extremely relevant to you but the fact is that almost none of them serve to further the class as a whole as they are much too specific and outside of the scope of the lecture most of the time. Please, please be mindful of the people around you because you are not the only one in the class. Every time you take up Geoff\\'s time asking a meaningless question, you waste someone else\\'s time who could be asking a clarifying question about something they didn\\'t understand. Just, be mindful man. All of your questions could just as easily be asked during Geoff\\'s office hours and simultaneously wouldn\\'t waste the entire class\\' time.It’s important because the issue here is access to students. He has high levels of contact with the members of JLTP. Is it not relevant when sexual harassers are in positions of power that give them more access to students outside of a classroom setting? Did you hear the first question at the event? It focused on access to students and researchers. This is one of those routes.I’ve often heard that about business majors (not Finance, accounting, but business management). Never heard that about Econ majors though. From my research, it’s a good major with good job prospects..I don\\'t live in a dorm lol YesTrue storyI know that! Just a suggestion Jesus Graveyards are full of people who thought they had the right of way.  \\n\\nMemes complete my life. I haven\\'t taken it, but some of my friends have and the general consensus is that it\\'s a walk in the park. From what I know it\\'s a bunch of basic Python, which shouldn\\'t be bad at all to learn. It\\'s designed for people with no coding experience. YMMV, but you should be just fine.Personally I\\'ve never had any issue with PC and I\\'ve been using it to go back home for break and back to campus for three years now. Sometimes they arrive earlier than expected to the arrival destination, but I don\\'t think they\\'ve ever really been late to it. You can just get to your boarding destination like 15 minutes before the time on the ticket just to be safe but they\\'re usually right on schedule. Pretty solid service overall.Pretty unlikely. However, there might be students studying at that engineering library called Grainger.Check your emails. If not look at the website you do hw in and check the announcements. ������All career fairs will have opportunities to have professional headshots taken for use with LinkedIn, etc. Worth noting that any student (of any major) can attend any on-campus career fair, so feel free to check some out in the future!

I also have emails from my other professors that semester to prove I worked with them. I did a little bit of research on retro-drop and I\\'m hopeful that even if this original drop isn\\'t honored, I have more than enough evidence to justify the retro drop. ESPECIALLY considering my original reasons were approved. \\n\\nThanks for the reply!I\\'m not in LAS, so your degree/gen-ed requirements may be different from mine.

If you want to an academic screening, I’d recommend starting now, they have limited slots each semester and it took almost the whole semester to complete because I had to come in several times.

Not gonna lie, it\\'s pretty tough even though I\\'m managing time really well. 385 labs take quite a while because of debugging and learning new systemverilog/getting acquainted with quartus and other hardware concepts. 225 is pretty easy until the mps and labs start to pick up after cpp is done and you start learning tree stuff. I\\'d recommend picking between 313 and 329It’s hard to think he isn’t mentally ill at this point. \\n\\nI’d expect this from a 3rd graderDepends on the major..

PHYS 325 is likely going to be the bulk of your efforts, with MATH 441 as a close second. As long as whoever is teaching 325 is still going at it with Makins\\'s course-style, you\\'re going to be good.\\n\\nMATH441 is highly dependant on the professor, but as long as you\\'re on top of the homework, which can be substantial some weeks, you\\'ll be well prepared for the exams.\\n\\nPHYS213/214\\'s daily workload is actually not too bad, with the online work being pretty doable. (if you\\'re taking 325 and 441, it sounds like you\\'re actually a physics major, so these should be the last of your plug-and-chug classes, hooray!) MATH347 is generally pretty easy, especially if you have experience with proofs and Math Logic. It\\'s also a class highly dependant on the professor (not the content, but just general annoyance)It\\'s a delusion that it\\'s primarily a fetish community, when it\\'s not.

They\\'re all off looking for a toilet.Well he also brought up the fact that ME curriculum covers many of the same topics that an EE minor would cover, whereas a CE minor would introduce more diverse topics. Personally I think the most important thing in picking any course of study, whether major or minor is personal interest in the topic. But regardless, I think picking majors that allow you to gain a larger breadth of knowledge is better than majors that will have a large amount of overlap.Ask them?Yeah tbh writing about your major and why you want to peruse it is v easy. So much easier than the common app personal statement god bless UIUCbless upYeah I know haha just comparing it to other schools�� and I applied through my Illini it wasn’t too bad the only sucky part was manually inputting your grades That’s not very good bait now is itI recommend signing up for Andinos class because his tests are easier, but going to Rays lectures because his lectures are betterI give you 300apparentlySoftware is an option, so long as you get into CS classes in the first place and are actually able to get interviews (hard part) and pass them. It might be a bit hard getting your first internship, but has not been too bad after that for me (already have one for summer 2019 at a different company).sounds like one of many who was thrown into this pit before discovering who he is and how to manage living on his own. since you\\'re already here, there\\'s little sense in talking about how it should\\'ve been. but you can think about how to make it better.

I do not know for sure but would be surprised if there were still any actual lead supply pipes in use on campus as these kinds of pipes were rarely used after 1930 but it is possible there is some buried in the ground on campus. Solder with significant lead content has been banned since 1986.  If you use a drinking fountain (one with chilled water) which looks to be older than from 1988 (lead banned in units made after that year) years or so you could be cautious and let it run for 30 seconds prior to making use of it - this to clear out any water which may have been sitting in it over night.\\n\\nContact F&amp;S and ask about testing in particular locations/buildings.With that thinking why go to a bar at all if you are underage?

Any criticism from a student here will probably be similar to the criticism that can be found in popular media. If U of I is your dream school, then apply anyway. I would recommend you to put your engineering major as your first major and whatever major that is low-demand as your second choice major. This way, you will definitely get in!\\n\\nIf you got into your dream major, then good for you! if not, you have to stay in your major for a whole academic year (You may only take the required courses from your desired major, however. Advisors won\\'t kill you if you choose to do that.) Some engineering courses have major restrictions, however, you can get around major restrictions pretty easily. \\n\\nAfter an academic year has passed, then you have to transfer to Pre-engineering if you are stilling aiming for your engineering major. (I don\\'t believe anyone I know who had applied was rejected from Pre-engineering) After your 3rd semester on campus, if you meet the GPA requirement of the engineering major of your choice, then you are guaranteed to get in. \\n\\nBe warned that College is nothing like high school, it is challenging to get a high GPA here. Getting a high GPA involves compromised social life, constant stress and questioning about the meaning of life. However, it is not *impossible* to get a GPA higher than 3.8, even a 4.0!

PLEASE check with financial aid about how this works.\\n\\nAgain, College Illinois works differently, so other students who stay within the 12-18 credit range would see no additional charges or refunds, as /u/Battlefront228 mentions.\"I\\'m Morgan.\"There\\'s sometimes where it\\'s not much more to fly out of Champaign than from Chicago.

As a Member of the 115th Congress, Rodney serves on the House Committees on Administration, Agriculture, Transportation &amp; Infrastructure and Administration. Rodney was also appointed to serve as Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture &amp; Research.\\n\\nSince the age of seven, Rodney has lived in Taylorville, where he attended public school. He continued his education in central Illinois and graduated with honors from Millikin University in Decatur.\\n\\nWhile growing up, Rodney worked in his parents’ restaurant, **His parents own a McDonalds franchise, he plays this both ways, sometimes he leaves out the mcdonalds part so you can think his parents own some mom-and-pop restaurant like this**  so he’s seen first-hand the daily challenges faced by small business owners. In his role as Projects Director for Congressman John Shimkus, Rodney became intimately familiar with the role that the federal government plays in our communities, where it can help, and where it can hurt. He was instrumental in helping Illinois citizens and communities cut through government red tape and works daily to provide support and relief to a wide array of important local projects.\\n\\nDespite his busy schedule, Rodney has always put family first. In 1995, he married Shannon, his high school sweetheart. At age 26, soon after the birth of their daughter, Toryn, Shannon was diagnosed with cancer. Drawing on their faith and family for support, Rodney and Shannon faced the devastating diagnosis head-on and prevailed. Throughout her treatment, Rodney never missed one of Shannon’s sessions. A year after Shannon’s initial diagnosis, they celebrated the birth of their twin sons Griffin and Clark. Today, Shannon is a 16-year survivor. She has her Masters Degree in Nursing and works in Nursing Administration at Memorial Medical Center in Taylorville.\\n\\nThe Davis family attends St. Mary’s Church, where Rodney served on the Finance Committee and as Volunteer Athletic Director. His other civic activities have included serving as fundraising drive chairman for the Christian County United Way, co-chairing a multimillion dollar YMCA capital fund drive, and serving on Christian County Senior Center Board of Directors. In his free time, Rodney enjoys watching his sons football games and track meets.\\n\\nIn the 115th Congress, Rodney will continue to work aggressively to end overspending, address the nation’s skyrocketing debt, **Rodney Davis voted for the tax cut that caused debt to skyrocket** and work to improve the economy to provide a better quality of life **Unless you have a pre-existing condition or need healthcare, as Rodney has voted on many occasions to strip the pre-existing condition clause from ACA and voted to wholesale eliminate the ACA on others** for the families of Illinois’ 13th Congressional District.Just have a basic idea about what\\'s going on and know how to use Ctrl+f and you should be good !Tribit xfree, only 50 bucks, great isolation, great sound, bluetoothCS majors, please stop bitching out pretending to be the smartest.

But the actual way one sets this up is much more sophisticated. log(z) is really thought of as being a function on the \"universal cover\" of the plane minus the origin. This function has a derivative which \"passes to the quotient\". That\\'s how you can actually mathematically make sense how to work with this stuff. Or, alternatively, for the case of holomorphic functions, you can think of them being defined by something called \"analytic continuation\". Multivariable calculus covers things not covered by complex analysis, so you can\\'t always use the same tools.\\nMy point is that this is unnecessarily complicated, not that there is no way to make it work. Bringing this stuff up will only confuse other students (and yourself) more. It\\'s really not the proper way to think about it even at a mathematically high level --  \"differential forms\" and \"manifolds\" are the systems that best summarize the content of calc 3 at a high level. Complex analysis is going in a separate, but tangentially related direction.It\\'s expired?309 makes ominous siren-like noises when the wind passes through it.What incentive do they have for being kind or efficient?

Believe me, I tried.You do not need to run every device for 30 seconds. Only devices manufactured after 1988 which is now 30 years ago. So learn to notice if a device seems new or not and that will let you know if you need to flush it - and you only need to do that if it has not been used in awhile. If the original water supply is good and the supply lines to an area are good then lead generally gets into the water only when it is sitting still for long periods and is in contact with metal containing lead. \\n\\nAround the US - as tests identify devices which are problematic they are turned off and or replaced. This is why the ongoing risk is reduced over time. \\n\\nPlease let us know what F&amp;S says as they may have a database of replacements they have carried out so people will know that X building has only new chilled water fountains (bubblers for some of you) and thus no flushing is needed. \\n\\nAlso some buildings have been built after 1986 - be aware of the age of the building you are in. If it was built after 1986 then the likelihood of an old device and old solder is very much reduced.\\n\\nPlease realize that where ever you are in the US what we are discussing is the same. It is not just a campus thing. And lead in water has a lower level of effect on adults than on children whose brains are still developing (especially 6 and younger).The quizzes are soooo bad. On quiz 2, the professor said over 40 people got 0\\'s. They keep telling us that the lowest quiz gets dropped, but does that really matter if people are failing every quiz? i’m pretty sure it’s against the student code You can legit google this shit.\\n\\n[for the lazy ](https://www.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;entry=s&amp;sa=X&amp;ll=40.098951,-88.2441761&amp;z=15&amp;ftid=0x0:0x1409bd558efed07d&amp;q=tailor+yong&amp;gmm=CgIgAQ%3D%3D&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiq4sGCmIneAhXpct8KHURjCUAQ_BIwB3oECAsQKg) I do; it\\'s just that I live on campus kind of far from the arboretum and I can\\'t just go to the arboretum every single time I take him for a walk, and many other people walk their dogs there as well. Some of the dogs are fine, but others are really leash reactive which is bad for training.  \\n\\nAnd I while I understand your point there\\'s always several extremely respectful people who aren\\'t asshats on campus. I run into asshats everywhere, be it a college campus, a large city, or a nature park. Hell, someone in Chicago tried to *kick* my dog when we were on a walk despite my dog not approaching him or even looking at the guy. I guess what I\\'m saying is that no matter where I go there are going to be good and bad people no matter the venue, it\\'s just that a majority of the time I walk my dog on the quad and surrounding campus area and I get frustrated by the lack of respect people have here. Signed for a job relatively recently, but maybe some professional development would still do me some good.It really does suck. Almost half my grade is made up of 3 quizzes with only 4 questions each, no partial credit. On problems with multiple parts, even if you get some of them right, you don\\'t get any partial.

Thanks, UnclePutin!!Give me 10 more minutes or maybe just remove the constraint of having to write in pen and that  would have been easy , but yeah not enough timeI mean, I get that, I just wish there was some place they could take it that\\'s a little more displaced from campus, and maybe a little more suited to racing. I realize that\\'s not really feasible, but I\\'m just wishfully thinking.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;im taking it rn as well, every section is completely different. Mine so far is 1 pop quiz a week based on 1-2 readings on MWF open notes, a weekly wrtitinf exercise done in class on Fridays, and you do your essay assignments usually 2-5 pages every other week along with a group project for the last 8 weeksThe question asked on Piazza (and yours here) is fantastic because it gets to the tricky parts of encapsulation and the exact scope of private member variables.   (We say \"member variables\" to denote that it\\'s a variable that is a member of the class, as opposed to being a [friend](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/friend) or otherwise.)\\n\\nThe `operator!=` member function has a [prototype](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_comparison) of `bool T::operator!=(const T &amp;other) const;`, for any class `T`.^(1)  This means that both the instance of the class it\\'s called on and the argument are both type `T`.\\n\\nIn C++, member functions can access **all private variable of the class**.  This extends **not only to your own instance, but every instance of the class.**  Therefore, `private_var_ == other.private_var_` (or `(*this).private_var_ == other.private_var_` to be more explicit) is legal C++ code because both `(*this)` and `other` are the same type of the member function\\'s class.\\n\\nHowever, no code outside of the implementation of the class could access the private members of the class.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\n^(1): Technically, the argument can be of a different type (we can define how to compare if some type T is not equal to some other type T2), but that\\'s beyond what we do in CS 225.  We will always write != in terms of another instance of the same class.No, but you can ask out your CS125 professor out  if you are riding the red VeoRide bike. As far as the psychiatric appointment at McKinley, my counselor actually called them during one of our sessions and arranged an appointment for me! That’s why I highly recommend going through the counseling center first regardless of whether you think you’ll need medication. It can take weeks or even up to a month for a psychiatric evaluation to open up at McKinley if you try to set it up on your own. But the therapists at the counseling center have a partnership with McKinley and are able to get priority for appointments since they will have already been seeing you for several sessions and can attest to the necessity of medication. At the psych eval, depending on the nature of what you’ve been dealing with the psychiatrist will ask you questions about your experience, what physical symptoms you’ve been having, etc. especially within the past two weeks. If she thinks you might benefit from medication, they’ll fill your prescription at the pharmacy at McKinley. The copay for the meds I’m taking is $5 for a month’s supply which isn’t too bad, and the rest is covered under student health insurance.\\n\\nI hope that helps! If anyone has other questions feel free to PM me, I love telling people about my experience :)FSpooky �� If you want to join an RSO try going Greek, UIUC has a massive Greek population and fraternities/sororities tend to push hard for member retention and involvement meaning you won\\'t have the problems you\\'ve been experiencing with people just dipping out after meetings. Other RSO groups that do lots of member contact are the religious groups such as the Christian youth groups. Extracirricular activities like the intermural rugby or ultimate frisbee teams are good bets too if you\\'re into sports. If that\\'s not your cup of tea try getting some roommates. Word of warning though this can be hit or miss of course but I\\'ve made lots of long term friends by being roommates first. I mean you all end up at the same place everyday and can\\'t really escape each other so it makes it easy to go out to bars and stuff together. Worst comes to worst start selling weed. Not going to lie I\\'ve made friends with my dealers before and hell when I was slinging myself some of my customers ended up being great friends.

I hopped on Tinder when I moved here last August. Up to now I\\'ve probably met 12-15 women on there. All of them super nice - very kind and respectful. I went on at least a second date with all of them, dated a few for a few months each, and had 3-6 dates with a couple others. I\\'ve also been on Bumble, OKC, and PoF and recommend all of them except PoF. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAll I can really do for you is ask the following questions:\\n\\n**1.** How\\'s your profile looking? I believe there are places on the internet where you can post your profile to ask for opinions; you have to sift through some bullshit but there is a thread of truth to what strangers on the internet tell you. Image-wise, there are some things that are just universally true, no matter who you are or what type of person you\\'re after. Among these universal truths are: \\n\\n* (1) Thou shalt not use low-resolution pictures. I don\\'t care who you are, if you have to squint to make out a face, it\\'s not going to go over well. An exception to the rule is if you have plenty of other high-res pictures where it\\'s clear to see who you are in varied settings and dress codes, and this semi-low-res picture is a big group thing or an in-action shot of something. But in general, clean ya damn pictures up.\\n* (2) Thou shalt not use only one picture. Probably goes without saying, but put as many pictures as you can.\\n* (3) Thou shalt have picture variance. You want to be doing different things / conveying different information in each picture. Currently my profile is like this: close-up portrait; group shot downtown Chicago; group shot outdoorsing; close-up personal / casual; in-action (boring-ass action, just walking downtown with a few friends); wide-angle shot of me standing on a bridge; in-action of playing pool with friends; group photo at a UIUC game; personal photo at a UIUC game. 5 different images of you smiling in your house won\\'t do it unless you\\'re drop dead gorgeous, which I am not.\\n\\nBeyond this, what you do next with your images depends on who you\\'re going for. If you need a stoner friend, a non-trashy photo involving you and your bong could do it. If you need a partier, you at a party. If you need a hookup, more sexual / body shots. Do what you gotta do.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**2.** How are *you* looking? Not the nicest question, I know. I\\'m usually declared to be a 7 or an 8, but that is a declaration made by close friends, and even platonic friends have been shown to choose to make friendships with people they find at least somewhat attractive, even if you\\'re not attracted to them / their sex. Women I\\'ve dated have called me an 8, 9, or 10, but again they\\'re probably dating me because they think I\\'m attractive. So I don\\'t know how the fuck I look. There really isn\\'t an objective answer to that, and even if there was, this wouldn\\'t be a nice conversation if all I\\'m asking you is \"did you win the genetic lottery\"? So let me expand on the question: how do you *present yourself*? Do you dress well, keep up with personal hygiene / physique, smile / lighten up your face &amp; body language when out and about, speak with confidence and compassion? Do you come across as too forward or too shy?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOne problem people encounter when they\\'ve gone long enough in life without gettin\\' some is they get more impatient. That\\'s totally understandable. But in my experience, I have never, *ever* gotten a date because I was trying my hardest. Those are usually the times where I fucked it up or came across as too forward. My successes are concentrated within this 25-75% interval of effort. If you get frustrated, no matter how hard you try to hide it, it *shows*, and that brings me to my last question.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**3.** How are you *feeling*? If the answer to it, whether in general or in a romantic context, is \"not so good\", you need to work on that. Forget getting matches; that\\'s something we could solve with an hour of writing and good lighting. Once you actually get the match, the toughest part is turning that into a date. As I said before, if you\\'re trying your hardest, it\\'s not going to work, and if you don\\'t try at all, it\\'s not going to work. You need to frame this whole Tinder business in such a way as to say, \"it doesn\\'t take any real effort to *be* on Tinder; therefore, I have nothing to lose if I don\\'t get any matches, or if none of my matches turn into dates.\" If Tinder is the #1, or even #2 or #3 thing in your life, it\\'s going to be a bad time. Even if you\\'re very attractive. It needs to be this thing that you just do occasionally as you go about your work / studies / sports / hobbies. If you place any greater concern into it than that, I promise you, matches will sniff out of the desperation. I know because I was there once. Losing your virginity is not the most important thing in your life. If you carry yourself in a dignified, ambitious, compassionate manner, you will find someone willing to steal that virginity away from you - I have no doubt about it ;).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd of course... I know you don\\'t like the idea of asking someone out in person. If you mean to say that it\\'s hard because it\\'s hard to meet a person in real life who isn\\'t associated with work or an RSO / social dynamic that you don\\'t want to ruin, then yes I agree with you. If you mean to say that it\\'s hard because you have someone in mind that you like, but you haven\\'t the courage to talk to them, then work on that. If you mean to say that it\\'s hard because you have been talking with someone you like but haven\\'t the courage to ask them out, then work on that. If you mean to say that it\\'s hard because you asked out someone you like, they rejected you, and now you\\'re afraid to do it in the future, you need to get over it. Sorry if the wording is harsh; what I really mean to say is that anything in life worth doing usually doesn\\'t come easy, and this includes asking out the person you like. There\\'s a thousand different pointers on what / when / how / where to do these things, so I don\\'t discuss that here.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nLast thing: I know I mentioned that I dated 12-15 women in a little over a year. I would say that about 50% of my time I was \"with\" someone, and 50% of the that timespan I was in between people or a loner. I am sure handsomer men than I are scoffing at my dating frequency, but (a) fuck you it\\'s not a scoreboard, and (b) every woman I met, I lucked out, and they were a wonderful person and I\\'m grateful for whatever time we spent together. My point is that I could go a week, a month, two months without even a match, and then all at once I\\'d get 3 or 4, and one would be down to start dating. I don\\'t really understand how it works, but for me, it feels like Tinder is successful in \"waves\" that can have a couple months\\' gap in between.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBest of luck to you. Hope this helps.I just shout \"bike lane!\"I\\'ve tried it out a bit too, Google has really outdone themselves this time. Great pics!thank you for letting me know my perfectly fine neighborhood full of beautiful old houses and trees where people ride their bikes, walk their dogs, and live their ordinary lives each day is \"kinda ghetto\". You\\'re an idiot...Doubtless my internal tuning fork has failed many a time, but it’s when it’s right that countsYou really didn’t, but if that’s not something you’re interested in, then it would still be possible to add CS classes but it will be difficult for 2 reasons.  1) it will be quite a bit of coursework and 2) CS is difficult to get into and attempting to go for a double major in CS without actually declaring it could make it hard to get into upper level CS classes.Some people just want to see the world burn[removed]I\\'ll put 5 karma on 6 pack.

The main principles from CHEM 102 that you’ll need to remember are Equilibrium( used for Acid-Base equilibrium, buffers and titrations), Thermodynamics(used for Free Energy and Entropy), and Redox reactions( used for Electrochemistry). I took 104 last semester with Andino and I can tell you that he will review the 102 stuff you’ll need to know before going into these topics. Overall you’ll probably be okay as long as you don’t totally forget everything from 102. You\\'re beautiful and have a nice day. That’s good to hear!

I\\'m trying to not finish my 3rd C++ mp for 126 rn anyway :) So Catch2 and JUnit are testing frameworks, in practice, they basically function as packages/classes that you include into one of your classes that has various methods to run the tests. On the 125 MPs, if you\\'ve ever seen the assertEquals or the assertTrue statements (I think they use JUnit), these are methods from JUnit that allow a programmer to provide two parameters and check if the result gained from the method is equal to the result expected by the programmer.\\n\\ni.e: `assertEquals(cat.isAnimal(), true)`\\n\\nwould result in a successful test. All the lines of green checkmarks (and the red and yellow circles, yikes) that you get when you run the tests in a program are from JUnit testing being implemented. Both Catch2 and JUnit are unit testing, meaning that you\\'re testing individual methods or parameters in your program, rather than running it all at once, which helps you to diagnose any issues with your code more effectively. To be perfectly honest, I had never done unit testing before when starting the first 126 MP, but by the second assignment it\\'s straightforward to get down. Copying down the necessary import statements in C++ to get catch2 functioning is probably the best way to get started with it, but all that is explained to you in 126 lectures (as in he lectures about C++ for 1 or 2 weeks while you\\'re still writing MPs in Java).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you\\'re on mac, everything is easy, and its straighforward to get compilers. When I used visual studio, you don\\'t need to do any big installs to get started with C++. But when I switched to the text editor VSCode (after a short foray into vim), it was a challenge, and I got help to install the compiler and get a unix based terminal. YMMV.Ask the UI police.

Honestly I was like this with one of my classes in my final semester of undergrad.  All I can say is just devote as much time as you possibly can to it.  You’ve already taken the first good step by talking to your instructor.  Straight up asking them “What do you think I should do in order to not fail this class?” is not the worst plan IMO.  Ultimately you have to weigh it up against your RAship.  That is probably more important than passing or failing a class, but I don’t know the finer details of your situation so it’s really not for me to say./u/jeffgericksonGroupme should work - https://groupme.com/join_group/45568292/AGUlf0how youre gonna pee??It\\'s - toxic by Brittney SpearzSquid refers to people who don\\'t wear any gear.

Last year, I was attacked by a \"friendly\" dog with no provocation. I understand your fear as I have trepidation around strange dogs.\\n\\nHowever. Many people train their dogs to walk on a specific side of their body. That\\'s not to say that they cannot move the dog, but the dog may become confused or less likely to adhere to it\\'s commands if it has been specifically trained to stay on one side of their handler. Not only that but if someone (such as myself) is walking two dogs, it can be difficult for them to move one dog to the other side, and put them on the same side as the other dog without frustration or tangling of leashes. \\n\\nIf you weren\\'t aware, many people also train their dogs to walk on a sidewalk. This allows them to see objects (glass, screws, trash, food, etc) that may be hidden in the grass; if someone has trained their dog to walk on the sidewalk, once again the dog can become uncomfortable and may not listen as well, and could even lead to the dog getting hurt if they\\'re unlucky. \\n\\nWhile I understand your fear and empathize with you, I will tell you what I\\'ve done since: I\\'ve gone out of my way to avoid strange dogs. If one is on the sidewalk and I do not feel safe, I move away from the animal. If one is off leash and running towards me, I slowly move away while not breaking sight of the dog. You can always ask someone move their dog, but you can\\'t expect everyone to be aware of and accept the issues you may be facing; it\\'s frustrating, yes, but it is what it is. \\n\\nI definitely agree with /u/uiucbitchslap though, and this you should try to go to the counseling center/see a counselor. Phobias are difficult to get over, but not impossible with the right help. I also don\\'t think others would get offended if you asked them to move their dogs--just understand that it might not be ask easy for some people to do, that\\'s all.

It is a United States and the rest of the world as well issue which has been made public for decades. This 30 second rule is true for your home or anywhere based on when it was built.

The lead is in the water ONLY if it has been sitting in older pipes or fixtures for an extended period. If the chilled water drinking fountain looks wet then someone has used it previous to you so it has been flushed. If it is 7 AM and you are the first to use it then let it run for a bit. A regular non chilled drinking fountain is less likely to have lead exposure as it does not have all the soldered fittings a pre-1988 refrigeration unit contains. So if it is a newer unit the flushing is not as important but it does not hurt to do so if you are concerned.

The dean shall then notify the student in writing, with a copy to the instructor. The notification may be in the following form:**  \\n**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ has notified this office that your attendance in**  \\n\\xa0**\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ has become irregular.

The dean of the student’s college, in consultation with the instructor, may determine that the student’s attendance has become so irregular that the student’s scholarship is likely to be severely impaired. The dean may require the student to withdraw from the course with a grade of Withdrawal or Failure.** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFurthermore, please note that instructors are *strongly encouraged* to present a syllabus that makes the course expectations as clear as possible. There is a lot more leeway given to instructors to modify their syllabus than students are clued into knowing. It is not *guaranteed* that the instructor can fail this student, but it is an incredibly strong case to the deans that if he asked for Morgan on 5 separate occasions, and assuming Morgan has not communicated any explicit formal reason for missing class so often, the deans can determine a withdrawal or incomplete as being necessary. I don\\'t know about an F, especially if enough of the course has already been graded. *However*, if the student does know show up for the final, even if their letter grade is already looking fine, they can be automatically failed.You\\'re right; I guess I\\'m just frustrated because while I do tell people in person to knock it off it never seems like it reaches a wide enough audience.

What there is for sure is paying back that debt.  There\\'s no getting out of it so the bankers who bet on student loans are guaranteed a payment.  I see a lot more focus and research at the university on recruiting new students rather than focusing on whether the teaching pays off with successful students later.  The university isn\\'t making money off former students.  I don\\'t buy that they haven\\'t increased enrollment to pad the budget a little.  How do I know I\\'m not one of those students?

I can intuit formulae in Computer Science, Physics, Statistics, and Mathematics faster than someone can explain them to me on a frequent basis.

This is often a sign of intelligence; being able to overthink things quickly make puns and deep jokes funnier. A lot of more sophomoric humor comes across as \"... but why is that funny?\" if the first step ends up being to overthink things.\\n\\n2) Ask questions about what thoughts we\\'ve been putting together. A lot of the time, I\\'m sitting on something that I\\'ve been putting together, like my theory that Don Quixote is the Nietzschean ubermensch, and am a bit antsy to find someone to vomit the thoughts at. Ask her what sorts of things she\\'s been thinking about.\\n\\n3) Discuss the things that fascinate you. Just because it seems simple to you, compared to the inner machinations of biochemistry, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not interesting on higher levels, too.

Second step would be to Google it. Third step would be to pore over textbooks and whatever other material. Fourth step would be to get help from people who know more than me, of which there are plenty. If, at that point, a dent still can\\'t be made, I\\'ll just hope the approximation is good enough.\\n\\nBut at no point in working on a problem like that am I going to task myself to do it with pad and pencil, no resources, and only ninety minutes.\\n\\nEvery time I learn a new thing in Mathematics, it becomes apparent to me where I could use it, where it would\\'ve been helpful to know before.

Do you have an idea of what kinda of robot you\\'d want to work on? What is your background also?\\n\\nMost hardware jobs for robotics tends to be on low level systems. This could be an FPGA, micro computer, or microcontroller. I am not familiar with the job market in this area, but I can only assume that it is good, but not better than general software (but if you are more interested in hardware I encourage you to do that). Both hardware and software are integral to the functions of a robot and my studies as a computer engineer has prepared me well for this. I am currently working on an FPGA project for one of the robots I am working with. I have also interacted with some of the micro-computers on the robot as well. I have also written a lot of software for both of the labs that I have worked in. \\n\\nWhat honestly helped me the most for learning robotics was not classes, but actually working and doing research in the labs. I also believe this is better than joining the RSOs on campus that are related to robotics.\\n\\nFeel free to send me a dm with more questions, I am avoiding being too specific about my experiences/research because I don\\'t want random people on the internet to figure out who I am in real life.Yeah.

And the people who say that are usually Americans themselves, most people in other countries don\\'t care what US high school education is like. Even on the PISA scores (which I strongly question BTW), the US doesn\\'t do all that badly, though it could do better.\\n\\nAbsolutely nobody in their right minds would deny that the US has one of the best, if not *the best*, post-secondary education in the world in terms of quality, although access and affordability are questionable. Here, I\\'m referring to 4-year universities, not community colleges, which are mostly unexceptional (not saying they\\'re bad though). \\n\\nSo how is to possible to have, as alleged, a sub-par high school education and an excellent post-secondary education? One reason might be that only 70% of high school kids last year went to college, and of them, only about 30% went into a 4-year college ([source](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/69-point-7-percent-of-2016-high-school-graduates-enrolled-in-college-in-october-2016.htm)). And public schooling in the US is paid for by property taxes, so kids living in rich neighborhoods go to better schools and then go to these top colleges. Those in poor neighborhoods don\\'t. The US education system is not a monolith, after all.\\n\\n&gt;Why is there no Silicon Valley any place else?\\n\\nChina produces more cellphones and computer chips than the rest of the world combined.

Its very doable One \"positive\" that was presented to Trump, according to the article, was that elite universities like Harvard had a lot of Chinese students and would suffer as a result (which, as the article points out, is not really true - public universities would take a monumentally greater hit). And since these elite universities have students and administrators that oppose Trump vocally, making them suffer is good policy. Really, that was supposedly discussed.

Actual answer, CS241 is a lot of work but is a good class to take earlier on since even if you don\\'t get too much of the actual systems part of the course it forces you to write good code and develop good software engineering skills. CS357 was fairly difficult for me but that\\'s because I forgot absolutely everything from linear algebra. CS374 doesn\\'t seem too bad, I\\'m taking it right now.

Is this for a class?AE433. Yeah it’s pretty frustrating, but I can see how it’d be very difficult to consolidate all this material into just a couple sheets, since the whole first unit is basically a review of ME300 &amp; AE312. Shitload of tables and charts. Still, I’d rather have them than have to calculate every single value by hand. And the exam is open tablet/laptop, so you don’t technically have to print these out, although using a laptop would be ridiculously cumbersome for the exam and I definitely won’t be.\\n\\nI’d bet that part of it is also that Rovey doesn’t have unlimited free printing either, as well as the fact that him transporting 100+ sets of dozens of pages would be even more impractical than just asking students to do it.I know that everyone is saying \"it is too early\", but don\\'t let yourself become complacent.

As students seeking knowledge, you should use this troubling event to learn about human behavior:\\n\\n# Exhibitionism\\n\\nExhibitionistic disorder is a condition marked by the urge, fantasy, or behavior of exposing one’s genitals\\xa0to non-consenting people, particularly strangers.\\n\\n## Definition\\n\\nExhibitionistic disorder involves exposing one\\'s genitals or sexual organs to a non-consenting person. This condition falls under the psychiatric category of paraphilic disorders, which refer to persistent and intense atypical sexual arousal patterns that are accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment. Exhibitionistic disorder was referred to as exhibitionism in previous versions of the DSM.\\n\\nThere are several subtypes of exhibitionistic disorder, and these depend on the age of the non-consenting person to whom someone with exhibitionistic disorder prefers to show their genitals. For example, the preference could be to show genitals to prepubescent children, adults, or both. Some people may deny that they show their genitals to unsuspecting others or deny that this act causes them distress; if they have indeed exposed themselves repeatedly to non-consenting people, they may still receive a diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder.\\n\\nThe prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown, but is thought to be approximately two\\xa0to four\\xa0percent\\xa0in the male population. This condition is less common in females, although prevalence estimates are unknown.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nA diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder can be made if the following criteria are met:\\n\\n* Over a period of at least six months, a person has recurrent and intense sexually arousing fantasies, behaviors, or urges involving exposing the genitals to an unsuspecting person\\n* The person has acted on these sexual urges with a non-consenting person, or the urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty in the workplace or in everyday social situations.\\n\\nExhibitionistic disorder is categorized into subtypes based on whether a person prefers to expose him\\xa0or herself\\xa0to prepubescent children, adults, or both.\\n\\nThe onset of this condition typically occurs sometime in late adolescence or early adulthood. Similar to other sexual preferences, exhibitionistic sexual preferences and behavior may lessen as people get older.\\n\\n## Causes\\n\\nRisk factors for the development of exhibitionistic disorder in males include antisocial personality disorder, alcohol abuse, and an interest in pedophilia. Other factors that may be associated with exhibitionism include sexual and emotional abuse during childhood and sexual preoccupation in childhood.\\n\\n## Treatments\\n\\nMost people with exhibitionistic disorder do not seek treatment on their own, and don\\'t receive treatment until they are caught and are required to by authorities. If you or someone you care about may have exhibitionistic disorder, early treatment is strongly advised. The treatment for exhibitionism typically includes psychotherapy and medication.\\n\\nResearch suggests that behavioral models are effective in treating exhibitionistic disorder by providing individuals with tools to control their impulses and find more acceptable ways of coping with their urges than showing their genitalia to others. Cognitive behavioral therapy may help individuals identify the triggers that cause their urges and then manage these urges in healthier ways. Other psychotherapy approaches include relaxation training, empathy training, coping skills training and cognitive restructuring (identifying and altering the thoughts that lead to exhibitionism).\\n\\nMedications that may be helpful in treating exhibitionistic disorder include medications that inhibit sexual hormones, resulting in a decrease in sexual desire. Some medications that are commonly used to treat depression and other mood disorders, such as SSRI\\'s, can also reduce sexual desire.For me there’s freedom in feeling like I don’t have to rush to get a job after college the people teaching my 241 always warn us to do the problem early in case autograders break, which means there are no guarantee that it will always run. it\\'s more of a bonus since technically you don\\'t need it to complete the assignment[deleted]Wait, are you the dude who posted about your roommate walking in while you jerked off?

There has been some talk about offering the MS as an option for students pursuing PhDs in other topics (e.g. experimental condensed matter), but once again I\\'m not sure the program has gotten off the ground. I would suggest that you get in contact with Lance Cooper, the associate head for the grad program, to find out what\\'s going on.\\n\\nOtherwise, the options for being involved in education as a grad student in physics at illinois are to pursue a PhD in physics education research, to get involved teaching the reformed introductory laboratory classes (which are research-based and a bit more demanding in pedagogy), or to take advantage of college or university-level certification programs.\\n\\nThe physics PhD program here is quite large in terms of number of students, and overall the department is a very friendly and supportive place.

Based on my experience, I don\\'t think the police would do anything.\\n\\nFour years ago I was brutally attacked by security at Presence Covenant Medical Center because I attempted to leave the ER without signing my discharge papers, even though the doctor told me I was being released. When I reported the incident to the city police, the officer got very angry with me and refused to even check the hospital\\'s security video footage. When I returned a week later to follow up on my report, he yelled at me to get out of the interview room, saying I was wasting his time and that my claim of aggravated battery is unfounded.\\n\\nTwo years ago I was riding my bike down Randolph Street and a teenage boy ran out into the street and punched me in the face. I fell directly into traffic and was nearly run over by a passing car. Then the kid jumped on my bike and started riding in circles through the middle of the street, taunting me, just before throwing my bike into the middle of the street. When I called the city police afterward to report the incident, the officer encouraged me not to press charges because it involved a minor and apparently there wouldn\\'t be any action taken.\\n\\nI could list several other incidents of being assaulted or battered and the police dismissing my concerns as inconsequential and unimportant.He was here in september, and there was someone in formal clothing yelling at people on the quad yesterday, so he might have been hereLife is a journey my friend. Think less about the destination and more about enjoying yourself day to day. A relationship won\\'t bring you lasting happiness unless you can figure out how to be happy by yourself. It\\'s trite but \"just keep swimming\" has actual merit. Just keep trying to improve. Find things that make you happy in the long and short term, like hobbies. Develop a skill that would make another person more interesting to you if they had it. Boom, you are now a more interesting person. Don\\'t strive for best or perfect. Strive for better.

Don\\'t talk to your parents everyday either because that sometimes will make you more homesick too. It won\\'t be easy in the beginning, but the pay off is more than you know.

It\\'s the festival of giving back and the birth of Christ not some plastic tree fuck fest. Don\\'t litter. Lovely nails does use LED lights if you do the no-chip shellac polish.\\n\\nThe stick on ones are usually pretty low quality and would definitely fall off pretty easy.\\n\\nLike I said, they will have to \"sand\" down your nails so they are super thin to do the acrylic. If you get them taken off, you will probably end up where you started, as they will be really thin and breakable.\\n\\nIf you\\'re not into the serum that prevents nail-biting, I would also suggest keeping your nails painted by doing it yourself or getting a normal manicure, possibly even getting shellac manicures so they last longer (a little more expensive, but less than acrylic). That helped me when I used to be a nail biter. \\n\\nI\\'ve pretty much kicked the habit of biting after keeping them painted and doing acrylic for a few years. I love having them long so I do whatever I can to keep them long and strong. I\\'m devastated every time a nail rips or breaks because it takes so long for them to grow out.Yep.

They\\'re going to suck.  You have very little agency and everything seems so god-damned emotionally significant all of the time.  Everyone\\'s telling you to behave like an adult but precious few people are treating you like one.  And at the same time, there\\'s this weird pressure to constantly be updating milestones and accomplishments, even if they\\'re devoid of meaning or merit.  Especially in this point in your life - everyone is loading down your every moment with an implied significance, because they see all the choices that led them to where they are and they want to make the choices at this point in your life seem more momentous. It\\'s a shitshow of a time, and honestly - it would take a vast fortune to convince me to re-do that section of my life.\\n\\nAfter, in your 20-somethings, it\\'s still going to be a bit of a shitshow.  You\\'re going to spend this time making professional or personal mistakes, way over-prioritizing one or the other, and you\\'re going to get hurt and frustrated often.  You\\'ll wind up heartbroken or broke or both at least once in a major way, and you\\'ll learn a little more respect for love or money or both. But you\\'ll also start learning the taste of the kind of life you ultimately want, and have a chance here to start cutting out the shitheels that keep you away from that.\\n\\nYour late 20s into your 30s is where things finally really start coming together.  You\\'ve spent a while now actually being the adult you, and the time you\\'ve invested learning what you do or don\\'t want has resulted in building a life around those preferences.  Things may still go wrong here, but they won\\'t be so catastrophic.\\n\\nAnd it just keeps getting better from there.\\n\\nTangible advice on how to make that whole process less painful:  Don\\'t hang on to grudges or shitty people.  Don\\'t accumulate debt if you can at all avoid it.  And don\\'t have children before you\\'re happy in your own life.\\n\\nLess tangible advice: Decide who it is you really want to be, personally, and start acting like that person here and now.  Even when it doesn\\'t matter, even when nobody is looking.  Actions become habits - your personality is very much an active choice, and you\\'re no longer tied to the happenstance of your childhood.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t be afraid to reach out for help when depression has you.  It might be friends, it might be a hobby, it might be a professional - but there\\'s no flaw in admitting you have needs that aren\\'t self-contained.The one time I took it, it was 3 hours delayed to go to Chicago.

I didn\\'t know I was supposed to call anyone about it I just assumed I could pay for it online&gt; I have to question myself as to whether I have enough time \\n\\nPersonally speaking, I manage to do a lot of stuff beyond my research (which is the equivalent of taking courses as a PhD student, although I take some courses too). Even as an undergrad, I managed to do a lot of non-academic stuff too. And I\\'ve always had to ask myself that question - do I have enough time to do this?\\n\\nI did and still do a lot of stuff. But I do everything in moderation. So I play video games, but only like an hour a week. I read books (not textbooks), but only for 30 min a day before I go to bed. I might hang out with friends once a week, or attend a concert of something once or twice a year. Basically, all non-essential activities are done in moderation, so while I can\\'t do everything all the time, I can do most things once in a while.\\n\\nFor essential stuff, I find ways to multi-task - cook food that doesn\\'t need to be monitored continuously while cooking (so I can do something else during the time too), get work done while running a load of laundry, etc. When I shop, I make sure to have a list so that I grab what I need and don\\'t just wander around aimlessly. \\n\\nAnd finally, I plan my week. I\\'m sort of addicted to my Outlook calendar and to-do list, and use them to plan what I need to do every day. Once I finish what I planned, I just leave - I rarely work late night, although I do work on weekends. If I can\\'t finish everything, I might let it go for the next, or if it\\'s really important, I\\'ll have to drop non-essential stuff and finish it. But on average, I manage to do everything I want to in moderation. [deleted][deleted]Nah, I think it\\'s the demographics of C-U.

In fact, it would be a good idea to contact advisors for research as soon as possible (e.g. tomorrow); even if you do not have the right classes in your transcript, it pays know what the professor you want to work with needs early on. I mention this because unless you are uber-aggressive, finishing these courses before starting research means you will begin research in your junior year, which is less than ideal (i.e. if you are applying to grad school, you will have 1 year of research experience under your belt; while almost all research project takes more than a year).\\n\\nRegardless, I don\\'t think it hurts to take 233 and 241 at normal pace (as opposed to delay until before graduation) -- they make you a better computer scientist, and you don\\'t need to finish all the AI classes to begin research anyway.That would put the average grade on the midterms at a 72.5 (midterms account for 48% of the grade), say the average on homework and WS is a 92.5 (20% of grade), and say the average on the final is the same as MT (32% of grade) that would put the average around a 76.5 - much lower than a B or an A that supposedly 68% of students get. And this is being super generous on the HW and quiz grade.

Crashes will always be with us, but they need not result in fatalities or serious injury. \\n\\nModern roundabouts are the safest form of intersection in the world - the intersection type with the lowest risk of fatal or serious injury crashes - (much more so than comparable signals).  Modern roundabouts require a change in speed and alter the geometry of one of the most dangerous parts of the system - intersections.  \\n\\nThe reduction in speed to about 20 mph and sideswipe geometry mean that, when a crash does happen at a modern roundabout, you usually need a tow truck, not an ambulance.  Visit the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety for modern roundabout FAQs and safety facts.  Roundabouts are one of several proven road safety features (FHWA).  \\nThe life saved may be your own.\\nhttps://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/provencountermeasures/roundabouts/ \\nhttps://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/intersection/innovative/roundabouts/ \\n\\n   Modern, slow and go, roundabout intersections have less daily delay than a stop light or stop sign, especially the other 20 hours a day people aren’t driving to or from work (it’s the #2 reason they’re built).  Average daily delay at a signal is around 12 seconds per car.  At a modern roundabout average daily delay is less than five seconds. Signals take an hour of demand and restrict it to a half hour, at best only half the traffic gets to go at any one time.  \\'At best\\' because traffic signals must have the yellow and all red portion (6+ seconds per cycle) for safety, and modern roundabouts do not.  At a modern roundabout, drivers entering from different directions can all enter at the same time.  Don’t try that with a signalized intersection. \\nOh ok, i see what you are going for.

In real life, you may not have to write down formal proofs, but you will often have to support software/architecture correctness/miscellaneous claims or even be able to refute other claims, which is reasoning that comes about through practice with formal proofs. In real life, nobody comes to you and says \"here\\'s how to prove yourself right and/or prove me wrong\".\\n\\nThe class does not need to be a higher-level class. More practice often makes for better outcomes. Logical reasoning is a critical skill to a true Computer Scientist.Never talked to an engineer but personally I would love a machine that could cut all three sides of a hedge at once. Of course it would have to be cheap enough for my boss to take a look at it.I’m not saying that your email isn’t valuable to you...just that if the data shows that 80% of compromised accounts are used to scrape academic journals by IP addresses in foreign countries that are under embargo, then that is where those attackers see the most value.  If they can’t get in by phishing your password, then 80% of phishing attempts and account compromises may go away.\\n\\nNote: 80% is a number I made up for effect, but when I worked there, a majority of compromised accounts were used in that manner.How is the class so far, I wanna take it next semesterOk TJ Henry Yoshi&gt; emphasize its reporting system after the mistreatment of bicycles began to appear on campus and online.\\n\\nToo bad their app is hot garbage[deleted]You are renting that chair. Check for signs in each place as some post signs with expectations. Is a cup of tea/coffee per hour too much for your budget? Get a tea/coffee and later get a cookie. I dunno but keep spending if you want these places to stay open. If the chairs are all full as they often are - if you are sitting and not buying then perhaps someone who wants to sit and buy will not be able to do so. So you double the effect of not buying. As a student you have many non-commercial options to use if you wish to study and can not afford and extended sit at a commercial establishment. This post is the reason Donald Trump is president. [2spooky4me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYYyUFb2wCQ)If it\\'s a traffic light then I\\'ll have zero complaints. But the point of installing a \"Stop Here for Pedestrians\" sign instead of a traffic light is to shorten the wait for both pedestrians and motorists. If either of them has to sit there for too long then the sign just becomes an infinite red light for them and defeats the design.\\n\\nCommon sense isn\\'t always right. If you go to some Asian countries the common sense is if you are a pedestrian you yield to cars or get hurt. Do you think it should be that way?Upvote.

Obviously I’m going to be biased but this is a great school to be pre-med. The academic advisors, specifically Brad Mehrtens, have been insanely helpful in making sure I’m on the right track. My sophomore year I ran into some major health problems and had to withdraw for a semester. The university was very helpful and accommodating. Mehrtens helped me stay confident and pick the right courseload when I transitioned back to school. The health advising team was also great in helping me adjust my path to med school. I’ve also been visiting the Career Center a lot lately cause I’m looking for a job during my gap year and have been really productive because of their guidance. \\n\\nIn terms of volunteering, you’ve got two big hospitals: Carle and OSF. I’ve volunteered at both and personally prefer OSF due to the culture, the shadowing opportunities, connections I’ve made, and the little benefits volunteers have. There’s also a lot of non-medical volunteer options that you can look into. Get creative because it’ll help you stand out. For example, I volunteer at a boxing place made specifically for Parkinson’s patients here in town. Also volunteer at Daily Bread Soup Kitchen, but I’ve been volunteering there since I was like 12 haha \\n\\nI don’t have too much research experience, but this is one of the best schools for research. Amongst my pre med friends I’m a minority in terms of not having a research position. This wasn’t due to a lack of opportunities but because of my circumstances I wasn’t in the position where I could take on another responsibility. And since the labs here expect quality work from students, I didn’t wanna be the reason a grad student had to pull an all nighter cause I screwed up his RNA Isolation. \\n\\nOh and lastly, i think the courses are fair at UIUC. They’re academically rigorous but that really prepares you for medical school and when it comes time to buckle down for the MCAT. You’ll get some easy classes along the way (S/O MCB 252) but the majority of them will require a strong work ethic and time management skills.

Zorbas used to be my favorite place for gyros...ECE alum and current TA here.  First, you\\'re right, there is arrogance in our departments, and it\\'s been that way a long time.  Second, the arrogance doesn\\'t necessarily go away ever.  In the industry, I bore witness to some very arrogant people who didn\\'t have the skill to back up the arrogance.  Some will continue to believe they are brilliant even as they pursue careers that require no technical competence.\\n\\nThis is not just these majors, nor just these departments.  Such people arise in the arts, in literature, in archaeology, and I imagine all possible majors.  They also exist in the people who never attend higher education.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOne caution: Don\\'t take umbrage with people talking to other people for a purpose you think is trivial.  That\\'s not your business, and you\\'re way out of line to lump that in as arrogant.  At the other end of the spectrum are the students who become jaded and anti-social.  Don\\'t join that club, either.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBack to your concern.  Eventually, some people will be necessarily humbled.  This might be from long nights working in a team on projects.  This might be from gaining an understanding of how much there is to know and how little any one person is capable of mastering.  This might come when they are in the work force and they make blunders that are easily detected by \"unskilled\" workers.  For some, they will never learn humility.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nYou need not worry about whether they have humility.  However, you and others deserve to be treated with respect.  If someone speaks condescendingly, call them out on it.  In fact, one of my students told me that they interpreted the way I was speaking to them as condescending, just this morning.  I apologized, I asked for clarification of what I said that sounded condescending, and I plan to keep their caution in mind in the future.now this is the kind of shitpost I expect from a Top 20 public school. bravo.Tomorrow, from 5-9pm, Chipotle will be donating 33% of each purchase made to the Illini Ridgebacks Quidditch Team!

I feel worse after every time I go out.  I\\'m not fun I\\'m not interesting and I\\'m really an asshole. I\\'ve just been faking not being sad and it makes me sadder. I\\'ve felt like such a piece of shit the last week I haven\\'t studied at all, haven\\'t done much of anything at all besides go out a couple times.

I really hope you like math.\\n\\n&gt; I look at all the homework and I don\\'t understand anything.\\n\\nThis is not a good sign. Even if you drop 347 this semester, keep working on the course material, so you can figure out what’s keeping you from understanding it. (And then mastering it.) Otherwise, 347 is not going to be better next time, and you’re more likely to struggle in 374 and 357.\\n\\nAlso, look ahead to the first week or two of lectures and labs and homework in 374. (My lecture videos from last semester are still online.) The early stuff is supposed to be straightforward, especially if you’ve had 347.

I have advised nine PhD students and a dozen master’s students; about half of my former students now have tenure-track faculty positions.  I have written recommendation letters for Illinois undergrads who got into top PhD programs, including MIT, Princeton, CMU, Washington, and Illinois (and maybe more than I’ve forgotten). I have a PhD from Berkeley and an undergraduate GPA of 2.4.  **I know what the hell I’m talking about, and I have absolutely no reason to lie to you.**\\n\\nAt least in computer science, once your grades are above about 3.5, other features of your PhD application matter far more.  That’s just the GPA you need to convince a human being to read your file.  The human beings (=faculty) who look at your application are looking for *strong evidence of research potential*. That means independent study projects, graduate-level classes, non-code-monkey internships, a research statement that reads like it was written by a researcher, and well-informed letters of recommendation that offer personal and concrete evidence of your research potential.  Creativity, insight, independence, attention to detail, stubbornness, hard work, taste.  Willingness to fail.\\n\\nHigh scores on closed-form limited-time questions with known solutions—everything you do in undergraduate classes—say almost nothing about your ability to do research, except your willingness to work hard.  Letters of recommendation that say nothign but “drwreject got an A in my class” (aka DWIC letters) are worse than useless. \\n\\nI am _much_ more likely to recommend admission to students who have stretched beyond their comfort zone, even to the point of failure, than students who played it safe and got a 4.0.  I have seen 4.0-GPA students flame out spectacularly because they can’t make the transition to open-ended maybe-it’ll-work-out-maybe-not research, and I have seen students with much lower GPAs thrive.\\n\\nIf all you have going for you are classes, then yeah, of course, optimize your classes; what else can you do?  But without other evidence (esp letters that say more than “He got an A in my class”), _even a 4.0 GPA_ won’t get you into a top-10 PhD program.\\n\\n~~\\xa0~~\\n\\n^(If you want to get into a top-10 PhD program to study *machine learning*, what you also need a first-author NIPS paper, letters from close colleagues of your target advisor, and the ability to roll box cars on demand.

It all stemmed from the fact that I was feeling quite down on myself one day because my exams all came down on me, and there wasn\\'t anyone to support me here - no girlfriend, no friends, nothing. I felt quite lonely at that moment, being so far away from family and all, but then I realized that I am a lot better than I am feeling, that I have a lot to offer to people and society and I need to keep on the right track. I still have moments of loneliness, I really do, but I try to get up and be productive or go for a walk, anything to forget. It is hard for me since I am out of state and I am older than may people are here; everyone has their friend groups and I just exist.

However, there are plenty of other IEs that don\\'t enjoy those same classes. I think they enjoy IE in general, but they view the classes as a workload they have to do, rather than interesting stuff they want to work hard to learn.I mean going to bars alone is lame, even borderline creepy as I assume you’re of the feminine persuasion.

Spanish is a European languageA humidifier is literally amazing I love it \\nGet it asapAsk your TA. I want to hear more about how small children are funding the university.Let me put your mind at ease.  In all likelihood, the ceiling lights you were hoping to have were 120V AC connections.  Most lamps that you buy?  Also 120V AC.  Now, not all sockets all the same - there are different sockets for different size bulbs.  One of the rooms in my apartment has a ceiling fan that, for some reason, had four refrigerator bulb-sized sockets under it.  (Tinier than the spare bulbs I happened to have).  \\n\\n\\nIn the old days, somebody would tell you the wattage of bulb to buy to get the amount of light you\\'re thinking of.  Today, power consumption for the same amount of light varies depending on the technology of light you are using, so you might use lumens to compare - lumens are an actual quantification of the light, rather than the power used by the bulb.  However, some LED manufacturers will also label the box as \"equivalent to\" a certain wattage of incandescent bulb, so you can make a good comparison.  \\n\\n\\nSO - why does it seem that ceiling lights are \"better quality\"?  If I had to guess, you have laps that are lighting the room by aiming their light at the ceiling, and then it scatters off the ceiling and lights the room.  They are also probably located near the walls.  The ceiling lights you are used to seeing shine their lights directly to the room.  \\n\\n\\nYou can absolutely light an entire room with just lamps.  They are the same \"quality\" as the ceiling lights you are thinking of, it is just that they are mounted on a stand instead of on the ceiling.  The kind of lamp shade you use, the direction you aim the lamp shade, and of course the brightness of the bulb you choose will help determine how bright the room seems.Volleyball, Golf, sometimes basketball, gymnastics also. My dude!I\\'m an ECE boi and I shower everyday. Where are my cookiesIt... kinda varies. Most of the time is quiet but there are moments when people are loud as they walk to their room or elevator.Woosh22 y/o here graduated in May 2017 at Comp E.

I personally don\\'t have her as a professor, so I am not really sure what she is like, but there are definitely ways for her to make piazza work for her. \\n\\nIf a professor doesn\\'t want to answer the question directly, or just want to get students to think, they could ask a question to get the student to think about a detail of the question that might lead them on the right track. Piazza is great for this kind of thing where you have to talk about the process, and not just the answer, and that is what a proof based course is. \\n\\nIn classes like physics, sharing the answer on piazza is not allowed, or just posting solutions to a problem for obvious reasons. Often times, the best answers give a little push in the right direction for a student who has been struggling, or explains where a student might have gone wrong while trying to solve a problem. I think that can def be applied to CS 173 in the future for the piazza page if it isn\\'t already. kill himThisWorking hard or hardly working?I do not mean to minimize your experience or feelings but they are not uncommon. The pace of things here and the level of expectations here are both higher than where you spent the past two years. The skills which helped you succeed there may not be the same skills needed here. So two suggestions:  first get the to the student counseling center and seek some support in your struggles to adapt. They have experience with others with similar challenges. And second work on your methods of study. Do not allow assumptions based on past methods which led to success cloud your thinking.  Ensure you are thinking of yourself as a remedial or entry level student who needs to take advantage of every opportunity offered for extra help as you may have a false sense of self reliance based on your past successes. You will again be self reliant after you have learned a new way to approach school and social life at this school.

It shows maturity. I used to get acrylic overlay on my nails when I was a bartender because the sanitizer would weaken my nails and they would peel and tear and break so easily. While they looked great and didn’t break as much, I will share a few words of advice:\\n\\n-\\tIt’s expensive. Just to get the nails on initially costs at least $20-30. Polish is another $5-30 depending on if you get regular, french, shellac, etc. You’ll need to get a fill in every 2-3 weeks (they put more acrylic on the newly grown nail, file it all down, reshape, and re-paint) which will cost you $20-40. These prices don’t include tip, either. I spent about $90 a month. \\n-\\tIt weakens your nails. They have to rough up your nails so the acrylic adheres and so it’s not too thick and looks natural. This means taking a manicure drill with a sanding tip and thinning down your nails. When you finally take them off your nails will be thin and brittle and ugly and you’ll have to trim them really short until they grow out. \\n-\\tAppointments aren’t short. I’d say every time I went in (2-3 times a month) it took 45 minutes to an hour to get a fill and a new coat of shellac.\\n\\nIf you still want to get acrylic, be sure you to to a quality salon. I highly suggest Lovely Nails up by the mall. Went to them for a long time and they do excellent work. If you’re getting shellac, make sure your salon uses LED lights to cure the polish, NOT UV lights (for obvious reasons). In my opinion, getting acrylic is not worth it unless you’re investing in having them long term. Just doing it one time and then taking them off is a lot of hassle. \\n\\nIf you’re just looking for a way to stop biting your nails, I highly suggest the treatments that you apply to your nails to keep you from biting them. My fiancé has always been terrible about biting his nails, and it has worked well for him. You stink It\\'s a different professor for online so the exams are diff but the in person prof used hw questions for the exam.

This makes the account less valuable and, therefore, should reduce the number of attacks.  In this case, my guess is that access journals and course materials is much more valuable than trying to read your email.  Putting MFA in front of those things also helps to get people used to using it without immediately requiring it for everything.

While their algorithm would obviously run faster than a genetic algorithm, especially for any problem that has a single, pronounced global maximum or minimum, it still runs into some of the same issues, and would be incredibly hard to implement for problems without a finite dimensionality; NEAT can generate networks - although inefficiently - of unbounded size, while that algorithm would require having full information of the structure of the strategy to solve the problem in order to adequately execute on its lasso method of optimization. Both of these algorithms would have an incredibly hard time producing complex behavior, because they\\'re both constrained to working within the neighborhood of what it\\'s currently working on. Random mutations at least have the saving grace of being capable of occasionally making the hail-Mary. Sure, you could put together something where the Lasso method explores larger and larger areas of space as its estimated gradient in local space\\'s magnitude goes to zero, but that would also take fucking forever to run.\\n\\nAnd, fine, if you insist, I\\'ll put together the second algorithm.

Which one is it now?\\nSo they are moving RAs out of the room w/ the private bathroom. What about disabled RAs? What about non-binary RAs? I thought housing supports people of all identities, but they don\\'t want disabled and non-binary RAs to work in those areas? What if non-binary students living in those areas **need** a non-binary RA?\\nAdditionally, that room is going to be expensive, because it\\'s a single with a private bathroom. What about disabled or non-binary students who can\\'t afford the price? *cough cough* they are selling it to those rich kids who have the money.\\nSure the bathroom wasn\\'t a universal benefit, but it still is a part of the job that makes all the work worth it, same as the free room, free meal plan, and stipend. Mind you back in the day RAs used to have free tuition. They also used to have less work, etc. Housing is slowly taking away the benefits while adding more work to the job, without really hearing RAs\\' needs. Where is the line you\\'re gonna draw?\\n\\nOther doubts:\\n1. Most buildings that are moving the designated RA rooms are old af, and are barely ADA accessible in the first place.\\n2. Some buildings already have co-ed wings/floor. If housing wants to adapt for non-binary students, why don\\'t they make more co-ed wings/floors instead of selling a more expensive room.\\n\\nSide note: \"if you\\'re only applying for *insert benefit* then you definitely won\\'t last through the process.\" This is a joke.

Time yourself, put away your notes, and make sure you understand and keep doing them over and over until you not only know the answers but also understand the logic behind them. \\n\\nECE 110 and 120. Go to HKN review sessions and take notes in class even if you don\\'t understand them. Then do the same thing. Take ECE 110  and 120 practice exams and if you don\\'t understand the logic behind anything go to office hours. \\n\\nI\\'m assuming you\\'re an ECE major. ECE 110 / 120 / PHYS 211 might seem hard but the reality is they\\'re by far the easiest ECE required classes. They\\'re supposed to teach you how to study and rule #1 of studying is office hours + practice exams + spend the time. overflowing with memes and advanced intelligence obviously\\n\\nand acktchually, it\\'s \"whose\" btw&gt; First and foremost, that would mean that MTD security would be confronted by the police for why they didn\\'t do their job\\n\\nYour theory is ridiculous.perhaps just the colder air - sounds travel easier in the more dense air.\\n\\nAlso dispatch routes change when there are streets closed so perhaps something has affected standard routes.\\n\\nOr homecoming celebrations are already getting out of hand.

Course load is generally pretty light, consisting of a weekly moodle activity and textbook homework assignment(average 2-3 hours a week for me). The midterm exam we took around a month ago was open notes/book, and you have an entire day to complete it and it isn\\'t that bad, as long as you review your homework assignments. It’s only your first semester, so just wait until the year is up to make a final decision.\\n\\nIf it’s something that you’re really serious about, look at other schools and start writing down their transfer requirements and focus on getting those courses out of the way for the next semester (or semesters).

You got this! :)You\\'re looking for JesusThis sub has mods?I can give you the basic run down. \\n\\nReadings are almost all Internet articles about how to be a mite tolerable coder, there’s even a few Reddit posts in the “readings” which I find amusing. \\n\\nLectures are the professor basically going over the readings with his own industry stories on top. They are very entertaining, even if they are mostly skippable. \\n\\nThere are a few in-class quizzes. You will know about the quiz ahead of time and will be sent a list of potential quiz questions a week prior. There are make-up quizzes that you can take no questions asked in case you miss one. \\n\\nThere are 3 assignments. Assignment 2 is a 2-parter, 1 and 3 are 3 parters. The first assignment is to design a chess game, the second is to scrape info from Wikipedia and analyze it, the 3rd is to create a mobile app that interfaces with Github. In addition, there is a 3-week final project. This can be whatever you want so long as it has merit (ie no Hello World programs).\\n\\nAssignments are presented in code reviews, which meet weekly in small group format. You will have a moderator who will critique your code and offer feedback. You will receive a 17% for showing up, and the additional 83% will be based on your code meeting certain functionality benchmark. That means you can bring in half-working code and still receive points. \\n\\nOverall you can drop 1 assignment week, not including final project weeks. You must have a score higher than 0% to drop a week (ie don’t miss your code review). Scores for assignments are meant to be harsh since the message of the class is nothing is ever perfect. The averages this semester have typically been 10-12 points lower than the max score (~50/60 points) \\n\\nThat’s about everything I can’t think of that you’d want to pull from the website Please do abort the baby.

And like one of the previous comments said, it may take a while for the paperwork to go in. You may not even be able to get an accommodation until the end of the semester. But you should actively try. You can even tell your TAs and possibly professors that you’re in the process of getting an accommodation and ask if there is anything you can do in the mean time. \\n\\nAdditionally, from my personal experience with DRES... make sure to advocate for yourself. Make sure that you are receiving what you need in order to be successful.\\n\\nI hope everything goes well for the rest of your semester! Good luck.

Students that have never programmed before usually find it challenging, but do very well if they have and put in the time required to succeed.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have much experience programming, I would take CS 125 rather than trying to pass out. If your programming skills aren\\'t rock solid you\\'ll be exposed in CS 225, CS 233, and CS 241. CS 125 also introduces a lot of conceptual material important for success in both CS 173 and CS 225&amp;mdash;recursion, trees, algorithm analysis, etc. Better to build a solid foundation for success in the later courses then risk struggling or failing downstream.\\n\\nIf you are still considering the proficiency exam, we have [a lot of information online](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/proficiency/).

A lot of their places are newly renovated and not too expensive. Most other cheaper places near the engineering part of campus are old, and are dirty in a way that\\'s impossible to clean, which I hate. They do a good job of cleaning between tenants. I got my entire deposit back from last year. They are not awesome but not the worst. If you want maintenance stuff taken care of, you have to submit it online and then usually visit their office to bug them if they aren\\'t taking care of it. \\n\\nYou should take a lot of photos, or an extensive video, of the state of the walls, floor, furniture, etc the day you are moving in and the day you are leaving. That way you can argue if they try to charge you for stuff. This is good advice no matter who you sign with.\\n\\nIf they say it\\'s getting renovated, and you only want to live there if it\\'ll be renovated, **get that in writing**. Otherwise they might decide to put off the renovation another year. It\\'s not a great idea to sign for a place based on what the leasing agency says it will be in the future.

If he thinks I did cheat and I can\\'t do anything, Ill take the 0 on the assignment I guess but I hope he dosent do that.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/UIUC) if you have any questions or concerns.*[deleted]Sounds like you should ask Tenaya Reifsteck and Allison Perry, as the email says. As in where else did I apply?Set your alarm tone to [*Sono Chi no Sadame* (JoooooooooooJo!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI3pg_YJnPM). You\\'ll wake up faster if you\\'re loudly playing epic music. Have this alarm literally across the room so you have to get up and walk over to your phone. Don\\'t have your smartwatch next to your bed either, because an alarm ringing on your phone will mirror to your watch. If you\\'re in STAT 400 and it\\'s early in the semester, do a homework problem with your coffee. (Probability puzzles are a good way to wake up.) Set another alarm for half an hour later to remind you that, yes, it is in fact time to rush the nearest Espresso Royale.\\n\\nI have never lived in a dorm so I don\\'t know if this would work, but you could try hooking up a Wink Hub to the university wifi, and then programming a smart light to blare blue light (i.e. that stuff that makes it hard to sleep when you\\'ve been surfing TVTropes before bed) at your alarm time.\\n\\nDon\\'t necessarily set a fixed bedtime, but try to keep the distance between your bedtime and your first class constant. (e.g. my first class on MWF starts at 9:00am so I try to go to bed at 9:00pm, my first class on TR starts on 11:00am so I try to go to bed at 11:00pm, my first class on Sunday (CS 196 oh yeah!!!) starts at 3:00pm which is late enough that I don\\'t care when I wake up.)\\n\\nUnder NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you binge on Piazza before bed. I know it\\'s tempting to help your fellow students for hours but 1) the entire interface is blue and it\\'ll keep you woken up and 2) you won\\'t be able to stop until there are no unanswered questions left.\\n\\nPlease don\\'t be stressed. To help with this:\\n\\n* Always do your homework same day (MPs and writing assignments are exempt) so you don\\'t have to rush LON-CAPA the night of the due date. \\n* Do your daily programming assignment on PrairieLearn the moment you wake up. (You have infinite tries anyway.) \\n* If you\\'re in a class like calculus that releases homework two or three lectures in advance, read ahead in the textbook and do the homework.\\n* Take notes during class (by hand) and pay attention to the instructor - if you do this you\\'ll almost certainly learn the material on the first try. You will probably never look at your notes again but [the mere act of writing down your notes forces you to condense the material and therefore learn it.](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away) DON\\'T FOLLOW THE ARTICLE\\'S ADVICE OF PUTTING AWAY YOUR LAPTOP - get something like a Yoga Book and write your notes on OneNote so they sync to the cloud. (This is why paper is inferior.) Speaking of which, especially in my mathematics classes I see people \"taking notes\" by copying the blackboard word for word. DON\\'T. It defeats the point. \\n* Now just because you don\\'t need to study doesn\\'t mean you don\\'t need practice. I can recite the definition and properties of a conservative vector field rote, and even I had trouble with the last question on yesterday\\'s calculus midterm. So do the practice problem packets. Do at least half of the old midterms. If you get something wrong *or you didn\\'t but the answer key is wrong*, go on Piazza/Discourse/whatever. If there\\'s an EMP session, use it. If there\\'s a student-operated EMP session like I\\'m running for Calc III, use it. If there are tutoring hours, use it. Don\\'t skip discussions unless there\\'s something super important (like a job interview). If the test is written, practice making your handwriting legible so that if you mess up you can be awarded partial credit.\\n* Study groups don\\'t work in general, but if you\\'re taking a foreign language course use all the study groups you can find. Language acquisition requires huge quantities of practice. Build Quizlet sets so you can memorize vocabulary easily. Flashcards are useless but Quizlet has a \"Learn\" feature that gives you dynamic testing. It works. If the foreign language is either Mandarin or Japanese make three Quizlets - English to phonetic, phonetic to ideographic, and English to ideographic. Work through the Duolingo skill tree if possible. The phrases are weird (「the woman is not a cat」, 「because of the leader the god kills the night」, etc.) but it works. Find a conversation partner on italki if you have to (or even if you don\\'t). Speaking of which, start engaging with visual material (comics, films/series, games) written in the target language:\\n* ____German: Watch *Dark* (live-action, hard sci-fi) on Netflix.\\n* ____Japanese: Watch *Bleach* (live-action, urban fantasy, is an adaptation) on Netflix. Read *JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken* (gothic~urban fantasy - note that the names of STANDS like スター・プラチナ and ハーミット・パープルare frequently rendered in kanji as 星の白金 and 隠者の紫, despite being pronounced as English words \"Star Platinum\" and \"Hermit Purple\" rendered in katakana). Play the *MOTHER* series (urban~high fantasy - note that there are no kanji and you will be forced to read phonetically).\\n* ____Korean: Watch *Train to Busan* (live-action, thriller) on Netflix or *Faith* (live-action, sci-fi/fantasy/superhero/romantic/what-even-is-this-series-but-I-love-it) on Hulu.\\n* ____Russian: Watch *Solaris* (live-action, sci-fi, is an adaptation).\\n* If you\\'re in a first year seminar (like LAS 101) attend even though it\\'s probably going to bore you out of your mind **unless it\\'s CS 100 which you should also attend because it is not boring**. (Most of your grade is participation.)\\n* CS 196 claims to be one credit, but it\\'s really more like three. So unless you\\'re a miracle worker like me don\\'t take it in a semester where you\\'re taking more than 15 credits. \\n* If a fellow student in one of your courses is making notes that look more like a textbook than actual notes, ask for those notes. (This student obviously knows more than any other student and by reading the \"notes\" you may learn stuff in advance for the courses to follow.) \\n* If your room is facing the sun, open the curtains so you wake up when the sun rises.\\n* If you have to traverse the Siebel-Foellinger path (the longest distance between two consecutive courses that I know of), please do so early *before your classmates rush Foellinger*. Speaking of which, learn to navigate by the three major landmarks - Foellinger, Altgeld, and Grainger are visible from basically anywhere on campus.\\n* Speaking of which, the center aisle of Foellinger (i.e. the queue to get your midterm) is wide enough for two side-by-side get-your-midterm queues. Please treat it as such, and don\\'t complain about other people who treat it as such.\\n\\nIn addition to not getting stressed (i.e. mental things) don\\'t get sick (i.e. physical things). \\n\\n* Shower every single day. With soap.\\n* Keep a bottle of hand sanitizer (preferably isopropyl alcohol 70%) on you at all times.\\n* I instinctively use CDC handwashing procedures and you should too.\\n* The moment you suspect you\\'re sick put on a surgical mask so you can\\'t infect anyone else and you can\\'t get double infected. For some reason I only see people wearing masks after everyone has already gotten sick? It\\'s kind of pointless at that point. Please put on the mask as soon as you start feeling symptoms.\\n* Do not skip class for flu/cold reasons. If it\\'s bad enough that you\\'re tempted to skip class it\\'s also going to last a whole week, at which point it will be impossible to catch back up. Of course you don\\'t want your classmates getting sick, or yourself getting two diseases, hence the mask.\\n* Discussions, on the other hand, are less important. Feel free to get permission to skip most of the time, but go to them anyway if there\\'s a test coming up.\\n* Keep up on vaccinations (unless you have an allergy or religious objection to eggs). Even if some people don\\'t get vaccinated as long as most people are vaccinated herd immunity is in effect.\\n\\nHope this helps!Basement of Union, theatre room.

My suggestion is that for the future exam, to do every single assigned problems decoste gave you and check it using solution manual in clc. Since your second midterm is approaching it is time limited, I suggest that you understand the free response questions from previous exams and commit to memorize. For multiple choice questions I suggest practice as much old exams as you can, you can get those from AIChE office, upperclassmen, and course hero. good luck!Speaking as an advisor, if those bad habits carry over to other classes, you have a problem.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf they don\\'t, then make sure to choose classes that are meaningful to you in some way in the future, so you don\\'t have other classes where you blow off the work, and otherwise you\\'re fine.Krannert Center has costumes you can rent. They use them in their productions. Expensive, but authentic afhe can\\'t keep getting away with itVideo games.We’ll be here, just colder!I\\'ve gone through this process. It\\'s a pain in the ass, but worth it. \\n\\nFirst things first: Call the counseling center first thing when you wake up tomorrow. They\\'ll schedule you a day-of appointment. Explain your symptoms and the issues you\\'re having. You\\'ll talk to a counselor and they\\'ll tell you whether or not they think you\\'re suffering from ADHD, something else, a combination of issues, or nothing at all. \\n\\nIf they suspect an issue, they\\'ll refer you to DRES for an assessment. I\\'m pretty sure at this point most if not all of the appointments will be booked up, but that doesn\\'t mean they can\\'t try. During the waiting time (took me two months even though I got the first appointment available) you\\'ll have counseling services available to you. I\\'d recommend attending these. My first counselor was great; second one, not so much. Just make sure you mesh well with the counselor, and if you don\\'t then request to switch.\\n\\nOn the day of you\\'re testing you\\'ll go to DRES; the testing can take anywhere from 4-8 hours. Mine took 5. I\\'d recommend just doing it in one fell swoop; much easier that way. Approximately 8 weeks later they\\'ll tell you your results; if you have ADHD (or anything for that matter) they\\'ll tell you and offer accommodations. \\n\\nSo pretty much:\\n\\n1. Call Counseling Center, attend appointment\\n\\n2.  Schedule DRES Assessment\\n\\n3. Continue counseling/attend DRES assessment\\n\\n4. Wait/continue counseling\\n\\nI wish you luck! Did you call mtd?I mean, I don\\'t give a shit how they do things there lol\\n\\nAnd what the hell are you talking about?I would strongly recommend doing it yourself.

They assumed that based on grading system of this school, that if it\\'s not counting towards your gpa, it has 0 credit hours. If your transcript or schedule says it\\'s 1 credit hour, then it is counting towards your GPA. CHEM199 ranges from 0-5 credit hours, so either TA thinks you\\'re taking 0 credit class, or there\\'s some sort of miscommunication going on that you have to talk to a higher-up about.

I lived in a three bedroom apartment on White st for two years (2015-2017) with two roommates. In the beginning it was fine, no complaints, they replaced our microwave within a week of it breaking down. But things went downhill from there. \\n\\nOne day the only washing machine in our laundry room was broken and when we called maintenance, they blamed it on the residents, saying someone stole machine parts. It took them over a month to come up with a solution (they gave us the key to the laundry room in the apartment building next to us) and we didn\\'t get a new machine until a semester later. They didn\\'t always keep up with shoveling snow and didn\\'t bother keeping the apartment building clean overall. Someone pooped near the stairs, there was dog poop outside our door, it was a mess. Finally when we moved out, they kept all our security deposit money and charged us extra for bogus things like \"stove cleaning\", \"fridge cleaning\" even though we had scrubbed everything clean. These charges also included a \"replacement dining table\" - a new dining table they gave us because the previous table was falling apart (it was part of the lease). So they shouldn\\'t have charged us. We went to their office to talk to them about the deposit, they said they only respond over snail mail. We sent them a letter demanding receipts for the charges and we never heard back from them.\\n\\nI think Roland Realty has some one-bedroom apartments near Crystal Lake Park for under $600.

I mainly just recommend joining stuff you’re interested in with shared hobbies or topics, and, most importantly, going to major social events/gatherings/parties etc of that Club. Taking that extra step helps, especially ifs a larger club or one that’s not specifically a social club. \\n\\nAdventure Club takes some new members at the start of the semester after interviews, so I’d recommend checking them out at Winter Quad day.\\n\\nOutdoor Adventure Club (different club) goes on hiking trips every weekend or so, and those are always open to hop in on if you like hiking/camping.\\n\\nThe Quidditch Team plays scrimmages here against other local colleges and tournaments within 3-4 hours driving on some weekends. We’ve done all our intro practices this semester, but if you were interested in checking it out we always welcome people at practices, and of course we’ll probably have intro practices at the start of next semester. \\n\\nThere’s the Social Gaming Club which plays board games/card games/video games/etc every Saturday as well if you’re into those. I haven’t been to that personally since freshman year but when I went they were always welcoming to new drop in attendees.\\n\\nThose are just the ones I have some experience with, but there’s certainly more for just about any interest/hobby/sport you have in mindGood to hear.

What\\'s important is that you do your absolute best to solve the problems in 225 on your own - really struggling with and thinking about difficult material is the best way to train yourself how to think about and approach new problems.

If you can get good at that, the more difficult material you\\'ll see in the future will be that much easier to deal with.

Not that it matters. lettuce came last week and they were pretty solid, even though their set was p short&gt; Like bottled water is just tap water from places with better water\\n\\nFor the most part, no.  Most bottled water is either filtered/treated or is spring water (then filtered &amp; treated).  Yes, the original source may be a municipal water supply, but that doesn\\'t mean the water is identical.\\n\\nFeel free to try a separate experiment: bottle some tap water, seal it, and give it a sniff a week later.  Most will smell less than premium.  Most commercial bottled water is not as chlorinated as tap water is, and this is the main difference you are paying for.  It\\'s also the main component a water filter removes to improve flavor.\\n\\nYou can try to gloss over these facts in your attempt to discredit bottled water, but at least get your facts straight.  Note, there are certainly disadvantages to the bottled water industry (also see the documentary, \"Bottled Life\"), and I drink mostly tap water.  But to be ignorant of the facts just weakens your arguments.NEITHER! Take CS 125 instead. You won\\'t regret it and Geoff is a fun instructor.Another negative Midtown lofts post.

Plan to take an extra year to graduate.  Sleep, exercise, eat well.  Have hobbies and friends and a life.  Focus on what you enjoy and what you\\'re good at.  Hang out with other people who enjoy and are good at similar things, or who at least appreciate the things that you enjoy and are good at.  If necessary, get professional help.\\n\\nAnd most importantly: Ignore the jerks who insist that you have to be the best at everything to be good for anything, *especially* if those jerks are just voices in your head.Having taken quite a few classes in ECE, the first classes aren\\'t bad. As you move through the curriculum, the classes will require more from you, sometimes reasonable, other times not. But one thing in common between all of them is whether or not you are willing to go through the bad parts, maintain a decent enough schedule, starting homework as early as you can, getting the help you need, and not falling behind. It gets very easy to fall behind; you miss a few lectures and don\\'t catch up on material the homework relied on, you now have to spend more time to understand how to do it, repeat. It can be a cycle that repeats a lot, and one I\\'m actually going through right now.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you have to be willing to commit the time needed to be successful. It\\'s not hard to just pass these classes with a C or below with some of these curves they give (391/374 as examples for CompEs). But for me, being able to graduate with good job prospects in a field I like because of classes I\\'ve taken makes it worth going through. You have to figure out whether or not it\\'s worth it for you because, while unreasonable at times, it isn\\'t always bad just by planning things out as much as you can.

A shower every day is not required. Most folks do wash up at the sink though. Face and neck, pits, groin, and then butt, because that\\'s where the germs grow and/or dirt and oil build up. If you are male and shave every day then you will probably want to wash your face/neck prior to shaving. In the US we tend to not like to smell body odor so we expect pitts washed and deodorant used. This also keeps our clothing from building up long term odors as fast. You can be opposed to doing that that but it will have consequences.

As the other commenter stated, we\\'d really need to know the actual course you\\'re supposedly getting credit for. If you\\'re in a dual-credit freshman general chemistry course, it will almost surely transfer as CHEM 102/104, which will not get you out of the first-year chemistry courses here. You must take CHEM 202/204.If you were so intellectual you would have had the video saved. Or known a phrase to find it immediately like I do. \\n\\n(Lol I know you’re kidding) I’m getting credit for my schools equivalent of all the first year courses except for CHBE 121 and the two 200 level chem courses.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the Chem courses, footnoted on the aforementioned mock schedule is this.\\n\\n“Students who do not place into CHEM 202, or who do not satisfy the mathematics prerequisite for CHEM 202, may substitute the sequence CHEM 102, CHEM 103, CHEM 104, CHEM 105, CHEM 222, and CHEM 223 for CHEM 202, CHEM 203, CHEM 204, and CHEM 205.” \\n\\nI did talk about this with the advisor but she kind of glanced over it, I’m thinking about contacting her again to get more info. I’m still confused on when I would take 222 and 223.\\n\\nIn regards to  CHBE 121. This is footnoted.\\n\\nFor students entering the curriculum after the freshman year, 1 additional hr of credit from the list of approved engineering technical electives (List 1) may be substituted in place of CHBE 121. The ENG 100 requirement will be waived.  Under no circumstances will these requirements be waived for students who are in the chemical engineering curriculum during their freshman year.\\n\\nSo if I would want to get this credit squared away, I would either have to take that elective another year (or if any of them have equivalents at my current school I could take them prior to transferring?

It very much depends on what you are trying to avoid which kind of wall and room will suit your needs best. Some walls attenuate high frequency sounds pretty OK but the lows will get through. Other walls such as concrete block may stop conversation but may transmit the sounds of chairs moving and beds moving and such.  \\n\\nIn any dorm there will be background sounds just like living in any structure (your home for instance) which was not designed to limit sound transmission. Most dorm walls have penetrations for data, electricity, heat, cooling, etc. so some sounds may move between rooms and hallways and even between floors. \\n\\nI don\\'t mean to sound like an ass but you have asked this question about many dorms and have not told anyone what you are trying to avoid. Avoiding all sound is not possible. If you have some kind of hyper sensitivity to sound AND you are unable or unwilling to use sound cancelling technologies then you will have problems in every dorm room. \\n\\nI do not wish to imply you have a problem but if this is an overriding concern and it affecting your University experience and performance in classes then I suggest you see someone at the Counseling Center to document what\\'s going on in case you need to request some kind of compensatory help wrt housing. There is nothing weird in that class they can throw at you, and hardly anything to memorize. You just have to learn the concepts, and understand the different methods they teach you for understanding forces on rigid bodies.\\n\\nI recommend redoing some of the homeworks to re-familiarize yourself with earlier concepts, and get more comfortable with the material in general.So how was it?I verify its credibilityIs Professor Harris the best professor? or is their only one?Are these math 285 and 415?\\n\\nUnless you specifically need both, I recommend Math 286 since it’s a combo of the two.

Believe me, I’ve struggled with my own phobia for years and although it’s gotten easier it’s still a pain in my ass. \\n\\nThat being said, I think you are in the wrong mindset. The truth is most people are not bothered by dogs, many people rather enjoy them. And with the sidewalks being public land, it is more convenient to walk your dog on the sidewalk than to find a more secluded location. In other words, dogs have as much right to be on the sidewalk as you do. \\n\\nAs a dog owner, I can tell you there is no such thing as complete control of a dog. Dogs do what they want when they want, you can’t make them walk in a straight line, especially not in environments with so much sensory input. Dogs are naturally inclined to sniff literally everything, and that includes you. \\n\\nSo what can you do? The easiest thing is just to yield to dogs. I know it’s a pain to cross the street when you see a dog coming, but it’s the best solution. In addition, you can try to manage your phobia. For me personally I’ve found that immersion has worked wonders, introduction of the stimulus in a controlled environment can quell your future reactions and allow you flexibility in your management of anxiety. There are also many wonderful therapists who’d be able to help you manage your phobia. \\n\\nUpvote so many times. The counseling center is a wonderful resource, especially for these types of situations. Pretty sure half this sub can relateI think you are the one with the reading comprehension deficit. \" At no point has OP suggest that the government punish the DI for their behavior\" ( censoring him).  On the other hand, if we value things like freedom of speech and quality journalism as cultural norms, we should privately advocate for them.  The OP has a moral right complain about both the poor journalism and being censored and he makes valid points. Just because the DI staff are constitutionally allowed to behave in a certain way does not make this behavior any less shit. We should look poorly at organisation and individuals that censor speech solely because it dissents from them because that is a thuggish and cowardly thing to do. The OP is not asking for the government to redress this and is bringing this matter up as something for us to privately decide and he is right to do so. There is no intersection with the first amendment. Your entire efforts here are a distraction.  \\n\\n\\nYour rudeness, and your arrogant ignorance of how your democracy works reflects poorly on America.   \\n The vast majority (94% in a 1999 poll) of people believe \"the average citizen should not be allowed to bring their gun into college campuses\" ([https://lawcenter.giffords.org/polling-on-carrying-concealed-weapons/](https://lawcenter.giffords.org/polling-on-carrying-concealed-weapons/)). Especially with an increased amount shootings at US schools and vast media coverage of such events, I would assume even more people now are averse to the idea of concealed carry on a college campus.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nReddit users also tend to lean liberal ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/517259/reddit-user-distribution-usa-political-spectrum/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/517259/reddit-user-distribution-usa-political-spectrum/) ; I don\\'t know the source of the data, so take it FWIW) and younger people generally lean left ([http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/)), so the intersection of those groups on this subreddit likely has a clear left leaning.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nu/HovarTM is also already known on this subreddit to make comments aligning with a far-right view, and his comments can tend to be inflammatory for this reason.Is the league xbone only?thank you so much ![deleted]I had the same question—[here ](https://youtu.be/6n3pFFPSlW4) is what they told me when I sent admissions an email. office hours about to get spicyI don’t support organizations that glorify sexual assault.

I think with CS + X in particular, there\\'s a lot of flexibility with the courses you can take within the +X section, and you also have to take general education courses, and all your CS courses as well, so it should add up to 120.

People think you use the fob and then open the door yourself but it\\'s automatic, so they break it. It will be halfway open most of the time. \\n2) They tried to tell a lot of tenants that they were going over the cap for their water bill. It didn\\'t make sense, especially because they said it happened in december when everyone was gone for break. There was a petition that went around and I\\'m not sure what happened with it, but they stopped with the water overage charges.\\n3) They took his entire security deposit. I guess it\\'s nice they don\\'t ask for a full month\\'s rent for it like other places, but they did take all of his $200 and try to say he owed more. He challenged their charges and they didn\\'t make him pay extra, but still kept his entire deposit. This is common in all realtors on campus tho, so I guess at least he got out of it by resigning and avoiding multiple security deposits being robbed.\\nBesides these things, it was a nice place. Everything was updated and the balcony was really a great addition (request one facing the park). It\\'s not super close to campus which kinda sucks considering the price they want for the rent, but if you have a bike it should be fine.F Sort of? I\\'m a junior in physics who takes lots of CS classes but is very into programming and has some CS friends, so I may have useful feedback here??\\n\\nThat said: First of all, you\\'re not alone in feeling this way. There\\'s been posts in the past expressing similar issues, for example:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/8b3yk2/cs_makes_me_sick/\\n\\nSecond: It does get better, I think. A lot of people in the CS program here are low-(or high-)key bitter about being rejected from &lt;insert university of choice here&gt;. As they get older, those feelings subside/they learn to deal with it and they become less obnoxious.\\n\\nThird: This one I only found out about recently, but apparently there\\'s serious... language? differences between a lot of people from different areas, that may come across poorly. The students adapt, and this one definitely becomes less of an issue.\\nFor example, I had a friend (call him Jimmy) who thought the first person he met (call him John) in the CS department was an ass because within 30 seconds of discussion he John had brought up that he\\'d been accepted to a university in Jimmy\\'s area with a full ride. \\nIt turned out the issue was that John was from a very different area than Jimmy, and where John was from, discussions about where you got in and how much scholarship money you got weren\\'t boasts, so much as just casual topics of discussion. The healthiness of John\\'s outlook was questionable, but it\\'s very possible a lot of the freshmen simply haven\\'t realized that in 99% of the world, saying \"oh yeah I got into X and Y on a full ride\" is almost as bad as sharing your household income at the worst and braggadocious at the least, and that the environment back home was somewhat toxic.\\n\\nFourth: This one just hit a sore spot for me, but a lot of people aren\\'t bragging about their \"unnecessarily complicated algorithms\" so much as just really excited about whatever they came up with. Solving problems in clever ways is really fun, and when you find a solution, of course you want to share it with people! I know my friends and I really enjoyed looking for more interesting bit-twiddling solutions to some of the 225 MP\\'s, and whenever someone thought of a better way, they\\'d immediately share it. I don\\'t think there\\'s anything wrong with mucking about in the problems and trying to find a better solution. I know I definitely learned some nice tricks from my friends, and would\\'ve been worse off had I not had these convos with them. I suspect if you\\'re looking for people who \"just like their major\" and aren\\'t sellouts, the people exchanging solutions are the ones you want to talk to.\\n\\nIf it matters, though, Jimmy and John are now rooming together, so clearly the differences weren\\'t that bad.ezThank you!

People expect there to be two types of classes, classes where everyone does pretty well and there is no curve, or classes where no one does well and there is a large curve. Most people were diappointed to see that after the curve on the first midterm only about 5% of the class ended up with an A. This makes most of us feel hopeless, like our GPA will drop if we take this class even if we do better than the average by a standard deviation.\\n\\n2. The class has by far the smallest amount of resources for studying for an exam of any class in the typical STEM track. Most classes I\\'ve taken have multiple practice midterms and multiple study sessions.This class had 1 set of practice problem (which on the first midterm poorly reflected the material of the test) and NO sponsored study session. Combined with the curve, this leaves students feeling like no matter what they do or how they try to prepare, there\\'s no chance for them to get the grade they want.&gt; Homosexuality is not the same as dressing up as an animal and pretending to fuck other animals\\n\\nThat\\'s not what furry is either, though.\\n\\nFirst, some facts: Only ~20% of furries have a fursuit at all.

If you ever decide to do this again, let me know! You have decided you want to study in a commercial space. Just because you like it does not entitle you to use it. Your apartment is paid for, your school buildings are paid for, you can use them \"for free\".  So too should you pay for this space. Yes you should spend the amount you can afford but realize it is a transaction and you are making use of heat, light, space, water, toilets, etc. You do have a responsibility to the owner and staff. Does the owner understand your need for a low cost space? Yes. Do they like their margins? I suspect not. Spending a dollar an hour does not seem reasonable to me. I don\\'t know what is the right amount but places are designed to operate with a certain turn over rate. If it gets too low they go out of business. By buying ever hour you help meet that turn over rate. [deleted]Breaking News, large bureaucracy inefficient, holding on phone still sucks.

Then since top universities are mostly in Beijing and Shanghai, students who are local to these two cities have an incredibly higher acceptance rate to local top universities than those from other provinces. So students from historically affluent provinces like Jiangsu, Zhejiang tend to go abroad for better education because of this inequality.Unless you feel you can\\'t apply yourself to get better in the course and/or it feels like a lost cause, it\\'d probably be best to drop.

One assumes you are a Jr. or Sr. so you should be able to speak to your professors and see how you are doing if you have few graded items thus far. I mention this in case you are studying at a rate/level consistent with your home school and that rate may be higher than expected here. \\n\\nAlso the system here expects a certain continuity of study from one course to the next (assumptions are made about what you know) and you may have voids in your knowledge (due to being an exchange student from another system) which you must make up. Perhaps this takes additional time for your studies. I’m not an international student, but I can at least partially answer your question.\\n\\nChina, for as populous of a country as it is, simply does not have as many prestigious universities per capita as the United States does. Because of that, it is especially competitive to get into those elite Chinese universities. And those elite universities are not always as good as their American counterparts. So from an admissions standpoint, it’s easier to get into a better university, despite it being far away in America. It’s more expensive too, but they’re paying for one of the best university educations in the world. \\n\\nOn top of that, studying at an American university has the possibility to work in America after graduation, if visa sponsorship can be obtained. On top of the opportunity of greater earnings potential, ultimately gaining US citizenship allows the student’s parents to immigrate to America, and transfer their assets out of China. That would be favorable because America has more respect for property/asset rights than China does. And even if the student can’t gain a job in America, that American education can translate to a good job back in China.\\nYeah definitely. I\\'ll let you know when I hear back.

There\\'s also Quad J\\'s educational outlook, which is deftly woven into his teaching- his lecturing methodology draws heavily from having a sense of humor, for instance. The autists understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to spend out hours a day looking at Mathematics, to realise that they\\'re not just true- they say something deep about HOW TO GET YOUR CODE TO STOP FUCKING UP. As a consequence people who dislike ECE truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\\'t appreciate, for instance, the usage of the (n Choose k) term in the Binomial distribution, which itself is based on combinatoric mathematics.

Then, [it depends further on your program](https://registrar.illinois.edu/tuition-fees/tuition-fee-rates/ug-tuition-cr-1819/) because multiple programs have significantly different fees.

In some states only the car ready to turn may enter. You can\\'t pull up behind them and also try to turn. I 100% understand your point and the reasoning behind it, but at some point you are going to have to realize college students especially are not going to understand or respect that. If you want to train your dog in a dumbass-free zone, why not take the pup out to Arboreteum or something like that? It’s more common than you think. I had a really rough sophomore year, depression,struggling in come classes, poor study habits(was one of those that didn’t need them in high school as well), wanted to give up, etc. At the end of my third semester I was at a 2.65. Over junior year I was able to get my shit together and right the ship, and was able to inch it back up to 2.85, hoping to keep the trend going. You *can* improve, but it’s going to be very difficult, especially given you’re halfway done and the GPA will start to lock in.\\n\\nDoing some very crude math assuming 4 years, exactly halfway done with credits, and not retaking anything, you’re going to need about a 3.75 average for the rest of your time here to achieve a 3.1. That’s probably not going to happen, so tamper your expectations now, and focus on improvement in general. Better is good, and you can try to sell that to recruiters (or, so I’ve been told, job hunt isn’t exactly golden for me now).\\n\\nLook at what you’re doing right now, and figure out what needs changing. How long are you studying before an exam? Start 2 days sooner. Are you going to Office Hours? **Go to Office Hours.** Are you studying in a group? Study alone more. Are you studying alone all the time? Study in a group more. Where are you studying? Study more in libraries/computer labs, it’s psychologically proven to improve studying to be in an environment with others who are studying. How much time are you playing video games or drinking or going to some RSO? Cut that down/out unless all your work is done.\\n\\nAdditionally, ask yourself if this is really what you want to be studying and where you want to be. This is the break point where you should really be deciding that. Honestly, I wish I had just changed to something I was more interested in, but it’s too late for me now. My old roommate was struggling hard his first two years, but then he changed majors and transferred and is much happier and doing much better now.\\n\\nThere’s a lot of things you’re probably going to need to identify and change, because doing the exact same thing you’re doing right now isn’t going to work. They may seem like insignificant changes individually but they all will add up to make a meaningful difference in your performance.NopeFree ice cream and baskin robbins and i think dairy queenHave you not seen her kick grange and butkus ass in the go cart races! Now here\\'s a senior design project I can get behindTry a subreddit specific to your field of study, most have a \"careers\" thread.The device that I am writing this on was made with semiconductors, constructed from PCBs, programmed with a BIOS and an operating system, running a browser that interacts with servers via a whole slew of cryptographic transfer protocols.\\n\\nDo I, as someone who would like to learn in the field, need to know how these things work? Yes. But very few other people on Earth actually do. I eat, despite not knowing how to run a farm. I ride a bus, despite lacking the MechE knowhow to construct one. I program in Python, despite not knowing - yet, I\\'ll be working on this one - how to create a compiler.\\n\\nThere is information where it is extremely useful for *someone* to know it, while it\\'s completely useless to just about everyone on Earth. What, do you think, is the ratio of the number of people who can work out the differential geometry for general relativity, to the number of people whose lives are made better by GPS, which uses GR in its calculations?\\n\\nWe live in a society that allows for the specialization of skills and knowledge, and that\\'s part of the beauty of it. The literature kids don\\'t need to understand how a semiconductor works in order to type into Word, and I don\\'t need to know the process by which a movie character is written to be engaging in order to enjoy a movie more because Thanos is likable.\\n\\nHowever, at the end of the day, the information that\\'s actually useful to the vast majority of people on Earth can be found far more readily in books than they can in college courses. Most people don\\'t need to understand the Haber-Bosch process of artificial Nitrogen fixation in order to eat foods grown with artificial fertilizer, so they don\\'t need to have a lab with the appropriate uranium catalyst lying around in order to practice. Most people do need to know to write a budget or do their taxes, neither of which need radioactive materials training.Best choice, Target.

I saw my therapist for about ten sessions, and while that was sufficient for me, she did tell me that if I wanted to keep coming back every other week for the rest of the semester I’d be able to! I just didn’t feel it necessary. However, usually with issues such as depression they do try to get it resolved within a semester, and if you have more long-term issues they will refer you to an outside counselor in the area. In that case, you would have to pay through your own insurance for those counseling sessions.This situation isn\\'t entirely out of ECE\\'s hands.

The man was Hispanic, and Madigan’s district is highly Hispanic, so the man though he’d have a chance. To counter this, Madigan directed two men with Hispanic-sounding last names to also enter the race. What had been previously an uncontested race was now a 4-way race. The catch was that Madigan’s plants didn’t run campaigns. Their campaign HQs were residential addresses and no one ever saw their face. It became obvious they were there to split the Hispanic vote and ensure Madigan emerged on top. That’s the kind of guy Madigan is.

I should say that by default, your social life isn\\'t going to be handed to you on a silver platter like it might be if you were part of a frat or some other social group. I know personally that it was very hard for me because I tended to stick to myself and I wasn\\'t good at being social. But my during my last semester of college, right now, I have decided that god dammit, I\\'m going to be a social mother fucker and I will do whatever it takes to make friends.\\n\\nI can tell you for sure that it doesn\\'t matter if you\\'re a transfer or if you\\'re in your later years of college, you can still find friends if you branch out and make a concerted effort to be interested in people and say yes to more things. The fact of the matter is that your social life as a transfer is directly proportional to how much effort you put into *being* social. It\\'s not going to be handed to you my bro.

Delet this It was so weird when I went to Kevin Elliot cuz lots of ppl recommend them. It was basically like they had never processed insurance before and they asked me a bunch of questions which I already gave them the info to + I already told them it was a 10% copay. After they finally processed my insurance, they called me and told me they had no availability left. They previously had availability but didn’t anymore because they were taking ages to process my insurance. So then I called up other places and got with an appointment in 3 days.

[deleted]Oh ok, where’s that at?I think that it’s important to be a person first, and let these things that are sources of anxiety for you not always be on the forefront of your mind.\\n\\nFiguring out why you’re majoring in EE or working hard on something might be an incredibly enriching experience. Trying new things to see if you like them, meeting new people to gain some perspective, and taking a completely unrelated class or two are just a couple ways to get out of the day-in day-out that can be studying in your discipline here. If you’re working on a project for a class and you discover yourself enjoying the work, bring it to a hackathon, present it at a conference, share this passion with professors and other students.\\n\\nDon’t let the small things you enjoy stay small things. There’s a lot of people here, all very talented, and feeling small or alone might feel natural, but there’s better evidence for you mattering more than you realize. Convincing yourself of this can be hard, but I can tell from your post that you want to do more.\\n\\n\\nI would be remiss if I didn’t also offer the support the university provides if you think this is an insurmountable challenge.

So even if you do end up taking CS 125 next semester, you can still finish the requirements before your ideal transfer date. But as an extension, 173 is generally considered straightforward to prof out of, so you can go straight to 225 next fall, especially since your current major (whatever it is) has its own required courses which will take up hours. If you\\'ve never coded, I\\'d recommend just downloading an IDE, asking someone to sit next to you, and just doing some basic java programming, such as some old MPs and assignments from introductory level CS courses. I\\'m sure a good entry point is even looking up AP CS assignments (from your hs or online) and just completing them. Best of luck.[deleted]Hi, my name is **J B Pritzker**!Thanks.

Major health problems or something would do itClasses: The caliber of class difficulty is pretty good. If you put in the effort and learn things well during your undergrad classes at UIUC, the first year of medical school is pretty much a giant review session. \\n\\nResearch: Awesome opportunities. Get involved early, maybe second semester of freshman year or first semester of sophomore after you’re all settled and adjusted to college life in general. Field of research doesn’t matter so much as long as you can show that you put in meaningful work, and care about it enough to talk about it when it comes time for interviews. Obviously more medically related research would be best, but anything bio or hard science related would work.\\n\\nVolunteering: Lots of opportunities across campus. Plenty of organizations that you can join that are dedicated to volunteering, as well as solo opportunities like hospital closet stocking or transport. Carle hospital system has lots of good medically related volunteering opportunities. Again though, any type of volunteering is good, it doesn’t all have to be medical.\\n\\nOther: If I were to point out any negatives, I’d say since it’s a large campus, there might not be as much focus on your individual success coming from the faculty as you’re used to, depending on your background. You have to seek out counseling to ensure you’re building a good application over the years. The resources are out there, but no one is going to push you to use them. It has to be done on your own initiative. Adjusting to college is hard, and premed can be particularly difficult when you realize that your GPA still matters when a lot of your non premed friend’s can slide by with the occasional C and still feel comfortable. Start off on the right foot because it’s really hard to pull yourself out of a rut when you’re a couple years in and aren’t on the track to be competitive for applications.\\n\\nI’m happy to answer any questions or elaborate if you want something more specific.If I use a zip car, can I park it at some zip car location near my destination and not pay for the time I\\'m not driving?Looks dope where is itNah fam.

I had this guy as a driver a while back.  I\\'m not going to give any real details to avoid doxxing, but he is a professional student in a respected department here.

Definitely intelligent enough to know that pulling over in a parking lot to rape someone as an Uber driver would result in being apprehended immediately.\\n\\nThis wouldn\\'t be the first Uber driver falsely accused of sexual assault.  That said, it wouldn\\'t be the first UIUC grad student to be engaged in felonious behavior either.  \\n\\nAnyway, I would recommend a bit of restraint before sharpening the pitchforks.  There is probably a reason why the police are \"investigating\" rather than arresting, because they certainly know who he is.  \\n \\n\\nEdit:  Holy shit, I thought this might happen but it actually did.  I was downvoted to oblivion for suggesting that someone accused of a crime was unlikely to have committed it, because of rational thought.  I seriously hope anyone who downvoted is honest about their biases when called before a jury...  man it\\'s crazy... I work here in a customer service role here at UIUC (don\\'t wanna get to specific, not important) and our standards for customer service in my office are high as fuck.

There are no unit tests to pass, not are the guidelines particularly strict. It’s a coding studio, not a coding class, there’s a big difference. Remember, bicycles are sensitive to water based lubes. Use WD-40 instead.&gt; Also, rushing to implement a solution teaches developers bad habits about automated testing and readable code.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s literally what coding interviews are.

I have been told the USA has a subpar educational system and how great the rest of the world does in educating their students.  Is it really true that higher education is dominated that much by the USA?  The new source is from the USA.  Other countries don\\'t even appear until #17 or #25.  China is #43.  It must have some bias toward the USA and the West.\\n\\n\\nMy thoughts on innovation are not far off.  The USA and the West are more open.  China attempts to control thought.  China banned the letter N.  Did they not?  Why is there no Silicon Valley any place else?  But international students come here for the quality of education more than that?\\n\\n\\nThe USA is also commercial.  If people are willing to spend money someone will supply the product.  Perhaps there are more schools of higher education in the USA?  Perhaps that is an opportunity for other countries to create more?[deleted]FCan you elaborate on how engineering in college can suck? What specifically about your life in college caused your depression/anxiety specifically? I keep hearing there’s a lot of work... but what does that entail? Going over what was taught in class alone?

You will hear music until your call is answered; if you hang up, your call will be moved to the order in which it was  received.\\nWhy same-day scheduling?\\n\\nThe Counseling Center provides a same-day appointment system. We ask that students call on the same day they would like to meet with a counselor. We use “same-day scheduling” for first-time appointments because we believe this allows us to reach students at the point of their greatest need. This approach allows us to offer support to as many students as possible each day. We are dedicated to providing accessibility and support services to our students.\"\\n\\nmy words next -\\n\\nMcKinley is not horrible. Realize please that just like on line reviews most of the people who make comments are the ones who are dissatisfied for some reason. Hundreds/thousands more will have had good experiences. Counseling with an MSW (Masters in Social Work) or a Psychologist is a two factor situation. The client and provider need to be able to work together. Sometimes the approaches and needs do not match well and then the client needs to try someone else. \\n\\nStart at the counseling center - you may then use McKinley after some sessions at the Counseling Center or you may find someone in private practice meets your needs better.

That worked very poorly, because 173 depended on topics before 190 got to them.    Worse, it would seem ok at the start of the term, so students had no idea how awful the later parts of the term would be.     That\\'s why the ECD 220--&gt;CS 125 prereq is in place.\\n\\nGood experiences with ECE 220+CS 173 (e.g. your friend\\'s cousin from a few years back) typically involved people who entered with significant programming background.    If you might be in that position, consider the CS 125 proficiency exam at the start of term.

I found out the class was pretty much divorcing itself from the pure physics of the former half of 329, which had topics like Maxwell\\'s laws. What 350 taught instead was just everything to do with antennas and Hertzian dipoles and other shit I didn\\'t really find interesting. I dropped the class pretty soon after the professor said during lecture something like \"If you don\\'t find this stuff interesting then you\\'re not an electrical engineer\"What are the odds he had been drinking and is trying to sweep this under the rug?Well, yeah.

R is a division algebra. C is a bigger division algebra that completely contains R (the biggest one where dy/dx makes any sense). Therefore extending R^n to C^n makes logical sense, just like extending Q to R makes logical sense.

The 3 main assignments, Chess, Web Analysis and Mobile App, are meant to introduce the student to libraries and programming they might\\'ve never encountered before. This in turn gives the student experience with industry level programing so they don\\'t graduate with only theoretical knowledge. \\n\\n126 is an attempt to do the following:\\n\\n1) Teach students good styling during their first year, beating good habits into students brains.\\n\\n2) Teach students C++ prior to 225 so that 225 can be more theory based.\\n\\nAs such, the coding assignments are likely simpler, and the emphasis is more on style than learning new libraries and techniques. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t worry about 242, they\\'re phasing the class out so you\\'ll never take it.

And honestly it takes time to adjust and make accommodations. I transferred here last year and I found myself always sitting at my desk doing homework and studying all the time and never going out. Well eventually, you start to go crazy and feel kind of depressed. I don’t know how to effectively study in college, and may not have the best advice, but here is what I can tell you:\\n\\nStart adjusting your bedtime to early. Do it. Trust me. Last year I was always up until 1-2am doing god knows what and I found myself sleeping in, hardly going to class, intentionally missing class to catch up in other classes etc. Well the start of the semester, I adjusted my bedtime Sunday-Thursday. I am physically in bed by 9pm and I am asleep by 10 pm every night and i wake up at 6am. I know it sounds early, believe I value sleep in my life, but this has helped me tremendously. I always get 8-9 hours of sleep and I feel well rested for class, and focused and energetic for 9am lecture. When I wake up, I have breakfast that I make while watching something on Netflix for a short time or scroll on social media. After I just do homework or any work i have to do. Then I get ready and head to class. \\n\\nBetween breaks of classes, I try to fit in any work that I have to get done. But always too, understand this may not be realistic every time. I know sometimes during my breaks between classes, I just go back to my apartment and make me a lunch because I’m hungry. \\n\\nAfter all courses for a day, I do more homework, review lecture notes and ask myself questions, and if I am confused with anything, I just shoot an email to my TA or Professor with any questions I have. Sometime in your day, try to go to office hours if applicable. Even if you don’t have questions, repetitiveness is good, it stays in your brain then. \\n\\nOnce it’s dinner time, I go home and make a dinner, turn on some Netflix, eat my dinner, and I see if there’s anything else I need to finish by the night, and I do that. Otherwise, I spent the rest of my night too myself or do whatever I want to do before I go to bed. \\n\\nOn Fridays and Saturdays, I have a rule to myself; unless it’s finals, midterms, etc, I do not do homework on those days  (unless something is due and needs my attention). But taking days off is good for your mental health, so you can reset and do what makes you happy like sleeping in. \\n\\nOn Sundays, try to go to the library or just stay in your apartment in your comfy pjs and drink some tea, and do homework all day. Like all day until like 6ish pm. \\n\\nBefore you pack up your work and be done for the night, look in your planner and see if there’s anything important due, and write out stuff for the week. \\n\\nAnd repeat.

I\\'ve yet to see any study that definitively concludes that second-hand smoke outdoors is even a legitimate health hazard (unless in close proximity to other people of course). Moreover, if second-hand smoke really is that dangerous that it warrants being banned outright from on an entire university campus, including sidewalks and parking lots, then it seems baffling that there is no state law prohibiting parents from smoking at home with children present. And studies by the American Cancer Society actually show children are far more vulnerable to the affects of second-hand smoke. Yet these smoke-free campaigns are clearly only concerned with encroaching on adult freedoms, with no actual concern for protecting the safety and welfare of people most at risk, i.e. children in smoking households.If it\\'s software you might be able to fix it yourself/get a friend to fix it.

They range in difficulty but most of the time the answers are straight up from the lectures, so you need to go to class which some people do not seem to understand. I personally rarely give out low grades and try to be as lenient as possible with answers because I understand that most people taking the class are not atmospheric science majors like me. \\n\\nAll this being said, there is math involved in the course and some concepts that are more technical but when it comes to the exams they are completely multiple choice or true/false. The first exam is this Thursday so I will have to see how the class fares with the new in class system.\\n\\nI think the class is amazing and is beneficial to anyone that wants to learn more about the weather and how it works. Eric is also an incredible professor and he wins one of the top professor awards at the end of almost every semester because of how great he is with his students. \\n\\nTL:DR- TA’s are instructed to not “destroy students grades” and are for the most part lenient. The class is harder than before and tests are in class but they are not writing tests and Eric is very accommodating.Yes* yesHey dude, I was in a similar situation with the class and I wanted to give you some advice. First of all, you\\'re in a far better position to do well if you can recognize your struggles at this point in the semester, and work towards improvement. I was doing much worse, and I ended up with a C-, so I think you\\'ll easily do better than that. \\n\\nHomework wise, definitely go to office hours. You may have to go to different hours to find TAs who will explain things to you, perhaps the concepts that you will need if you struggle with those. Also talk to peers in the office hours, in class, or your lab mate (if have started the hardware labs). This class is a class that most people struggle with, so they\\'ll be happy to help you out. If you like your discussion section TA, perhaps look out for their office hours, since they will know you better and you can be more comfortable talking to them. \\n\\nIf you still don\\'t find office hours helpful, then I would advise going to the CARE sessions at Grainger, 4th floor. Here\\'s the link: http://care.engineering.illinois.edu/tutoring-resources/tutoring-schedule-by-course/. Scroll down to ECE 120, and look for times that work for you. You can also look at the tutors here: http://care.engineering.illinois.edu/about-care/meet-the-care-team/#electrical-computer-engineering, to see if you know anyone who is very knowledgeable in this class (ex-TA/UA). Generally, the CARE tutors are good, and you get a more 1 on 1 experience (until the end of the semester). \\n\\nAbout the professor, it is unfortunate that he isn\\'t passionate about teaching or he\\'s not very understandable. This will definitely happen a few times in your academic career. If you have time, you can try going to the other lectures (9am and 10 am).

However, if you have financial aid, you may want to watch how much you add or drop after the 10th day of a semester. Those extra hours that are billed eat into the maximum number of hours you get towards financial aid, which is 150% of the credits for a degree which is typically 180 credits for a degree of 120 hours.

Basically what\\'s going on is that the Suites at Third are \\'restricting\\' themselves to only renting to a tenant with a guarantor if the tenant doesn\\'t meet the income threshold.  When a contracting party imposes a condition on itself, that party can waive the condition and execute the contract because it\\'s a self-imposed restriction.  It would be like if I were buying your house and said I will only buy this house if you get a home inspection.  Closing date comes and you haven\\'t gotten the inspection and I (foolishly) just say well I\\'ll take the house anyways!  You might think, \"oh, that\\'s void because there was no inspection.\"  However, since I was the party that required the inspection I can waive the condition and have the contract executed.  The same principle applies here; because Suites at Third are imposing the restriction on themselves, even though the other party does not yet have a guarantor, the Suites at Third can execute the contract and waive the condition.  This does mean, however, that if Suites at Third executes this contract without the guarantor and the tenant just lives there anyways that they cannot then require a guarantor, at least insofar as I understand this lease agreement.Accurate.I believe there was a cease and desist order as part of the ongoing state AG investigation into the company requiring that he remove the company from campusNo judgement at my apartment!

Especially when almost everyone is trying to get into software.. I always felt like loner here because I like fields and waves, physics, circuits, microwave stuff.. and everyone else is just trying to get a cushy job in California and get free food everyday.. I don\\'t know. It depends on you. I\\'m just annoyed everyday being around those type of people.. It\\'s like the same person, multiplied.. same way of talking, same lingo, etc.. (e.g. oh I took a L on that HW dude), there are girls here but most of them look as you\\'d expect.. There are some hot smart blondes, but you can just imagine how hard it\\'d be to reach those girls knowing they\\'re all that and a bag of chips (hot blonde engineers). The other thing that really annoys me is the superiority complex. I\\'m not saying I\\'ve innocent on that one, but for the most part I find it off-putting.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAcademically, EE courses are very conceptual and have heavy math. You have to do a lot of self-learning because lecturers usually go fast and are busy with research and don\\'t spend too much time talking with undergrads.. Then you go to office hours and find out the TA barely speaks English or is just hard to understand. Sometimes the TA hates the class but was assigned as a TA to it because they received an A in it as an undergrad here and they need their tuition paid somehow. The EE exams are tough, they\\'ll ask questions you haven\\'t seen on the homework, or they\\'ll ask some questions about unfamiliar circumstances (example: on the homework you look at electromagnetic fields in Cartesian coordinates  and apply the familiar right hand rule easily, on the exam they\\'d rotate the coordinate system to where sines and cosines would show up, and applying boundary conditions became tougher.. Or in communications they show put simple stuff on the homework like a homodyne receiver, but then on the exam there\\'s a superheteordyne receiver with multiple IF filters, with a tuning range given for the oscillators and a short amount of time). So basically you have to master the concepts and be able to solve basic, new problems quickly if you want to get an A. Lastly, there are required CompE classes like ECE 120, 220 and 385.. 120 was mostly okay except the homeworks were long, 220 was my least favorite class in UIUC (must code all the time to learn, can\\'t just read lectures or pseudo-code on paper), and 385 I actually enjoyed but we had to write a lab for the previous week while working on the current week\\'s lab.. and then there were 4 weeks at the end for a final project. I mean if you want multiplication to have the intuitive properties multiplication has, and ALSO to \"work\" as expected for natural numbers, then you\\'re forced to have negative * negative = positive.\\n\\nI think that saying it \"comes from the definition of a ring\" is disingenuous, when even in a formal setting you can treat it as a \"nice\" extension of multiplication on the naturals so that you keep your properties. If anything, rings come from this reasoning and not the other way around.It’s like the scene in The Departed So?It\\'s just a joke and people downvoted lolFrom the student-created visualization \"Grade disparity between sections at UIUC\" that I maintain (http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/), ECE 210 has significant variance between instructors/semesters.

Are less percentage of graduate students in CS 446 getting As Bs and Cs than undergraduates (which I find unlikely) or do graduate students tend to perform better and therefore aren\\'t curved as much.\\n\\nUsing GPA averages is definitely not the best way to judge the difficulty, numerous ECE 5xx levels that I would consider some of the hardest classes on campus (i.e. ECE 534) have much better averages than most undergrad classes. \\n\\nBut I would say GPA averages are useful to figure out your chance of failing.

Also, I\\'d be more inclined to believe that they\\'re lying about their furry-ism not being sexual because they\\'re scared.  They\\'re already taking a big risk in admitting they\\'re furries at all, and the roommate was showing that he wasn\\'t comfortable with it.  Back to the homosexual comparison, if you\\'re a flaming gay guy, and you\\'re trying to warm up your homophobic roommate to you as a gay person, you\\'re probably not gonna show them all the different ways you like ramming stuff up your butt.  You\\'re probably gonna try to show them the positive aspects of gay culture, and how it\\'s an identity and a lifestyle.  And because it\\'s the sexual connotation that tends to creep people out so much, I think these two furries were trying to move past that in order to show the aspects of their lifestyle that would be easier for a non-furry to enjoy so that their living situation could be a little bit more peaceful.\\n\\nBut, apparently you\\'ve met a ton of furries, so I should probably just take your word that statistically speaking, these two are untrustworthy schemers that get off to people not understanding their sexual nature.My GPA is around there and I found a job for the summer, it\\'s not impossible.

And I swear every time I go into the bathrooms in Altgeld, someone is in a stall with a smell that makes you want to change majorsI think in a very real sense, the international students are subsidizing education for in-state students. As government funding and/or enrollment of Americans continues to decrease, the significantly-higher tuition paid by international students makes up the difference...which is that main reason the University started heavily courting international students to begin with. \\n\\nOf course, most of the international grad students (like many grad students) don\\'t pay a dime...and that shit kind of pisses me off. Like, there should be a need to demonstrate that no qualified Illinois residents were available for a research/teaching assistantship before it\\'s offered to non residents.

I know you guys have been feeling down lately. Maybe we can help one another feel a bit better even just by talking.As an admitted classroom vaper I hate when people are blowing clouds in lecture rooms.

And you\\'re dealing with highly-variable temperatures, both due to our weather and because you\\'ll be going in and out of class.  If we get really nasty weather (e.g. -20F or deep snow), this place shuts down.    So don\\'t get the polar expedition type equipment (e.g. heavy parkas) and emphasize multiple layers and items that you can unzip or easily remove.    \\n\\nOn top, you need at least one light layer (e.g. fleece, flannel shirt), a light jacket that will fit over it, and a \"3-season\" parka (puffy and goes to mid-thigh).     Parka should be loose enough to fit 1-2 layers under it.     Outer layers should resist wind/water.\\n\\nSome people like insulated pants or underlayers.     Warm but hard to remove.    And not really needed if you keep your upper body warm.\\n\\nYou also need winter gloves, a warm hat, and a scarf.     Should be cheap.    Gloves should have a water-resistent outer layer;   the all-knitted ones are useless once wet.    \"Thinsulate\" is good.\\n\\nYou also need a pair of boots.    Go for lightly insulated, fairly low (just above ankles), and moderately water resistent (e.g. hard leather).      Think about walking through cold slush, but only a couple inches deep.     Also look for ones that might double as hiking boots.    Get some \"smartwool\" socks first and make sure the boots fit over them.\\n\\nThe boots and the parka will be a bit pricey, but you can get really nice ones for maybe $200.     The rest does not need to be expensive and should be re-usable in warmer places (e.g. California).[removed]Still no closer to writing that algorithm though (for him).[softrain.bandcamp.com](https://softrain.bandcamp.com)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nlmk what you think!A lot cheaper, but be mindful of where you choose to live if you are not from around here. \\n\\nCheck bus routes if you don\\'t have a car, check on parking costs if you do, etc etc \\n\\nAnd just make sure it\\'s not in the ghetto.

After about an hour, some nurses and a doctor came into the room and said they were going to inject me with a psychotropic drug to \"calm me down\", even though that is in direct violation of state law (forced medication of mentally ill patients is illegal). When I refused to take the shot, they called two husky guards into the room and said I can either voluntarily take the shot, or the security guards will be required to restrain me and make me take the shot in violation of my civil rights.

If you are being ditched then they have reasons for doing so. Some reasons may be internal to them but some reasons may be based on how you are acting/interacting. To that end you may want to do something uncomfortable. Reach out to a few of these people (ones you thing well of in general but never the less they ditched you) and tell them you are looking to understand yourself better and ask them if there are reasons you are no longer connected with them. You are not asking to reconnect but asking if there are things about you that made them less likely to hang out with you. They may not respond or they may tell you stuff that you may not want to hear (it may even be wrong stuff but you will hear impressions).\\n\\nAnother thing to examine is are you trying to be connected with the right kind of people. Are you connecting with people you feel like you *should* try to connect with OR are you connecting with people who have similar interests and activity/engagement levels.

But success in ECE (or whatever) has far more to do with work habits than intelligence.\\n\\nIn fact, your intelligence may be the problem!  I\\'ve met lots of extremely bright students who have always found math really easy, until they suddenly don\\'t, because the problems are too complex to solve \"in one breath\", or they require an uncomfortable level of abstraction, or they can\\'t be solved by step-by-step instructions.  Students who *don\\'t* find math really easy, but do well anyway, develop study habits and problem-solving skills that more \"intelligent\" or \"gifted\" students just don\\'t need.  Until suddenly they do.\\n\\n&gt;It\\'s just that the problems they assign cause you to do soooo much internal thinking\\n\\nIt *sounds* like there\\'s some structure/intuition/process that you\\'re just not getting, and you\\'re trying to muscle your way through by rote memorization.  Don\\'t do that.  Back up.  Slow down.  Go to office hours, and ask  about *how to think about the material,* about *how to approach this kind of problem*, not just how to do the homework.\\n\\nAnd if the TA asks you a question, try to answer it in good faith.  They\\'re trying to help you practice, because practice is the only way to learn.You guys do realize that Veoride doesn\\'t exclusively service the campus, right? They have a joint contract with the cities of Champaign, Urbana, and the university.Anyone know if there\\'s any relation to victor Oladipo? Probably not near campus. Off campus you could probably find a 2 bedroom house to live in for that price. If you have documented behavior of this stuff and a doctor, you could apply for a disability with DRES and get accommodations. I know that’s probably not what you’re looking for but I didn’t realize my MDD counted as a disability for a long time and I really wish I had because my accommodations help me out so much when I get that cant get out of bed type of depression. With how hard ECE sounds I’m sure the accommodations would be generous. Just a thought u/queerdeviant did an awesome weekly post like that until s/he had to go back into the grad student dungeon.Quality commentGo to office hours. If you never have went or \"think\" they wont help, that\\'s just another barrier for you to be successful. Don\\'t make that excuse because it seems like you havent got to office hours at all, so you need to stop fooling yourself to not go because everyone learns differently and going to office hours might help figure out how you learn personally. If you’re close to me that would be really appreciated, but otherwise I’m not going to ask you come to where I am. I’m in LAS, so if you’re in another college, it could be different. The best way to be safe is to ask your advisor, though.

Ball games are often on the TVs. People express opinions and groan and applaud at what they see.  Depending on the bar sometimes people behave like it’s a family holiday dinner and touchy subjects like politics and religion are avoided.  You can chat with folks or not. You can be among others but alone if you prefer.  But there is nothing stopping you from joining in if there is an obvious round table discussion going on. People dream out loud sitting at a bar. “Man I’d go on one of those spaceships to the moon if I had a chance.” And then folks will laugh at you or with you and tell you why you are an idiot or a brave soul.  It’s not always like Cheers (old TV show) but if you show up periodically the bar keep might get to know you and some of the regulars might too.  You can eat a meal or just some peanuts while you have a beer or a soda and just listen and jump when where and when it feels appropriate. But you are a visitor to their scene at fist so try to spin up to their frequency a bit else you might put a wobble in the scene.

Nobody cares about your unofficial midterm grades right now; you only have a high school record available for evaluation. Usually freshman transfers are evaluated only on high school record.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you were denied due to lack of Calc II, it\\'s possible that you\\'re a sophomore-by-hours from AP credit or dual credit and Admissions will hold you to the Calc II requirement for transfers. But it\\'s worth asking Admissions whether they can reconsider based on the fact that you\\'re a freshman-by-years.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOtherwise, you could reapply in spring to join in summer or fall, whether you do Calc II and the rest of your spring classes at your current school or at a community college. I don\\'t know how all the Admissions processes work, but speaking as an advisor, I\\'m always happier when there\\'s a semester\\'s worth of grades to view for transfer students, to know whether it\\'s likely that they\\'ll be able to handle the work here, as /u/TomECE suggested.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnd just to be sure--you can\\'t use Stat here as a backdoor to Engineering here later, in case you were considering that.

Meromorphic means an actual, honest to god, function with isolated singularities which are poles (a special kind of singularity). Look at say, the wikipedia page -- log is listed as an example which is *not* meromorphic on the entire complex plane. Being meromorphic has nothing to do with being multivalued. In fact, you can\\'t be both -- unless you restrict to a branch, in which case, log(z) is actually holomorphic, not just meromorphic (away from the branch cut).\\n\\nDivision algebras are also completely irrelevant to anything here. I\\'m not sure what you\\'re saying, but if you\\'re saying that you can always just extend smooth real variable functions to complex differentiable ones, then you\\'re wrong again. For an example, look up \"bump functions\". There are smooth functions which aren\\'t analytic in the real case; this is impossible in the complex case.\\n\\nAll of this is irrelevant to what I was saying. I was saying, from a pedagogical standpoint, talking about branch cuts and analytic continuation for anything in calc 3 is quite silly. This whole conversation is quite silly. You should really consider toning it down with the high powered math talk.What do you do at catering?

Bed rooms are tiny, living rooms are okay, and the location is great. Building always seems half a step behind what the maintenance needs. Common complaints are that the hot tub never seems to be cleaned and most of the amenities that they brag about close at midnight (my friends and I are night owls so we rarely get to use them). Most of the building isnt really finished (concrete unpainted walls, exposed pipes) but they market that as a feature. The view from the upper floors is pretty good though. I can actually see Joes and Lion from my living room.\\n\\nIts certainly an upgrade from the dorms (which I feel are the biggest scam a uni has every run), but its location is prime. I will not be renewing the lease. For around 600$ you can find almost the same thing without any of the \"amenities\" (small gym, crappy hot tub, dirty deck, slow elevators, limit on free utilities, nice theatre \\\\[when it is clean\\\\]), and pocket the $200+ difference as booze money (my plan).\\n\\nWhile I dont regret living here, its kinda a one and done thing.

The class spends the first half of the semester learning HTML, CSS, and Excel, and the other half learning Python. The class was honestly very easy.

According to your usage [branch and bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound) is a heuristic approach. Your usage of computational time lacks all understanding of [models of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation), and doesn\\'t even come close to the correct term which is [exploration vs exploitation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/10703/Lecture_Exploration.pdf).

Real mathematics is far different and more difficult than what you have seen before ( I assume that at your community college you have not seen higher level math than calculus and maybe elementary linear algebra/diffeq), and going to grad school in math is not easy.&gt;the work is the dot product between force and **displacement**\\n\\nWhen the vector field is not conservative, as is the case with &lt;y, -x&gt;, this is not true. A good example is friction, which always acts against the relative motion of two objects. Say you move a box in a circle around the floor, considering friction. There is no displacement, but it clearly took work to move the box in the circle. The box and floor are now hotter due to friction, so work has been done on the system. As friction is a non-conservative force, unlike gravity, this assumption regarding displacement does not apply. \\n\\nThis same argument can be made for this vector field, as moving in a circle around the origin in the xy plane yields a nonzero answer. If the physical interpretation is confusing, look at the raw math, which says that the force dot r\\' is constantly -4.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;F\\nI\\'ll second this. Champaign\\'s library has been awesome to study atThe reason you need to call in at that time is because it is for students who are really going through a tough spot at a random time and if they booked appointments in advance there is no way they would be able to see the person who\\'s dad died that day because they are all booked up. That being said, there is no real way for them to build up a clientele  because they aren\\'t making money on individual sessions like a normal practice. They have tons of people to see which is great for their experience, but since it isn\\'t going to cost 100 dollars per session out of pocket they may not really feel that pressure to do super well (unless it is an intrinsic quality where the counselor doesn\\'t care if they are paid case to case and treats it like their calling or something) so I feel it is better than nothing in my opinion. Eventually the counseling center won\\'t even be an option for you after graduation so it also could be a good learning experience to navigate the different clinics in the area where most likely you would get a lot more of a personal connection because they don\\'t have as many people to see as UIUC does.

There\\'s a lot of questions so I\\'ll be brief:\\n\\nEcon is really good here, we have some of the best professors here at UofI. There are clubs for economics, but I would recommend looking into accounting or finance internships if you decide to come here, since I\\'m not sure there are many companies looking for someone just for economics, maybe for marketing. Our business school is also really good, pretty much every professor has been in the business for at least 5-10 years, so Finance is a great option.\\n\\nSchool-life balance is very easy here once you know what you\\'re doing. If your parents made you do everything in high school, you\\'re gonna have a rough time here unless you adapt quickly. Just write down assignments and expect to have at least around an hour of homework a night. **Study for midterms.** This isn\\'t like high school where you don\\'t have to study for anything.

The best cost to value will be below 100$ (actual cost will be 200$-250$, but mark downed to 100$ or below). Colombia seems to be the most affordable brand. North face is definitely better than Colombia, but costlier. I would recommend Colombia Interchange which is almost equivalent of the North Face Triclimate. If you don\\'t want to go to Burlington, try and look for odd colours like neon blue or so on. They are generally marked down below 100$ on Amazon.

Find what is not making you happy. Are you around toxic people? Do you spend too much time on social media? Are you allowing yourself to relax and have social time every once in a while?\\n\\nWhile you may have found the things that make you happy, find what is still left that is bothering you. I found when when I dropped social media ( other than reddit/ fb every once in a while) I felt less stress and anxious. I also made more alone time because I felt like I always needed to be around people and doing things to feel like I’m making the most of my time. Make a list of things that make you happy and don’t make you happy and take those cons and do something about them. They aren’t permanent and you have total control over your life and happiness.\\n\\nOn top of that, I also found that journaling once a day took SO much stress and sadness out of me. It gets it off your chest and in a book no matter how dramatic or small it is in your head. It’s a free therapist.\\n\\nI haven’t been there, but I heard the counseling center on campus is super nice- maybe try to find time to check that out. \\n\\n\\nI promise everything will turn out just fine and you have worked really hard and gone through all this for something in the end!! Keep going. You are very close to school ending too! :)Coke whores, all of you.If you want a serious response -- You seem to have no idea what an engineer\\'s work actually entails, and a pretty unrealistic view of things.\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, the number of people working on something that is life/safety-crititcal is *extremely* few. The vast majority of engineers are NOT working on building bridges.\\n\\n\\nSecondly, even for those engineers who *are* working on something life/safety critical, for something to go wrong during development is more of an indication of something being wrong with the *process* rather than an indicator of the quality of engineers. I.e. not enough people checking each other\\'s work, only 1 point of decision rather than multiple. \\n\\n\\nThirdly, a job is absolutely NOT reflective of a test. For you to even say that, it sounds like you\\'ve never even done an internship. As you said, a test is a high pressure, adverse environment. On the other hand, a job is WAY less stressful. In fact, there\\'s a whole department in most jobs DEDICATED to keeping the work environment as peaceful, calm, and relaxed as possible (HR). \\n\\nIn a job, you generally have the ability to consult other people, the ability to search things up on the internet, and the ability to *use a fucking calculator*. It is extremely unlikely for a job to ever reach levels of stress comparable to CBTF. If it is that bad, you find another job instead.This is a photograph of a projection of a photograph of a cat looking at a laptop monitor displaying a photograph of a projection of a photograph of a cat...

Northface like the northface triclimate is good, and thrift stores / discount stores will have better offers. FFUUUUThis was true up until this semester.  However, starting Spring 2019, CS is expanding prereq enforcement to CS 225 (just as CS started doing in CS 173 a few semesters ago).  If you do not satisfy **both** the programming prereq (one of: CS 125, CS 126, ECE 220, or equivalent) and the theory prereq (one of: CS 173, MATH 213, or equivalent), you will be removed from CS 225 starting in Spring 2019.\\n\\nIf you have a programming background (and therefore able to proficiency intro programming) and plan to take CS 173 and CS 225 in two semesters, you must take the CS 125 proficiency.If getting high is an instrument I\\'m ini did it but i won’t help If I get an 86 I\\'ll be happyI also took took this exact schedule with CS 125 two years ago and it was also fine.How do I focus on my programming skills?

So it\\'s a tough question, because I\\'m sure there are people out there like me who won\\'t be comfortable no matter how you ask, while there are others who are probably receptive to some degree. I think you\\'re just going to have to accept that some proportion of women, myself included, find it uncomfortable to have a strange man come up to them and ask them to dance. You can\\'t change that. You can continue to do it and just accept that fact. I wish I had a better answer for you.Maybe try the Danville Civic Center?Fuck. You are correct, sir. Thanks for the perspective. He isn\\'t. Because this is a shit post and if he was serious, his friend would be laughed at and told to fuck off. For the most part, people go out to have fun and hang around with people that they actually know. 9 times out of 10, they want to stay with their group rather than dance with a random stranger. It\\'s really just weird to approach someone by yourself in that situation.\\n\\n\\nAlso, you mentioned that you go out by yourself. Not saying that there\\'s anything bad about that, but I can almost guarantee that it raises some red flags and can definitely be seen as creepy.\\n3rd party will never win with that mindset\\n\\nGet out there and smash that mf vote button... thing!!\\n\\nVoted early so idk how you plebs do it in the pollsCivil engineers, help me! I am scheduling for my second semester sophomore year. I know I have to take:\\n\\nPHYS 213 (2)\\n\\nCEE 202 (3)\\n\\nTAM 212 (3)\\n\\nTAM 251 (3)\\n\\nfor a total of 11 hours. I need one more class to fill things out.\\n\\nOne option is to jump into a 300 level CEE course. With my current credits, I can take:\\n\\nCEE 320 (Construction Management) or CEE 330 (Environmental). Now I am interested in pursuing constr. management as a primary, but I would also be interested in environmental. My question to civil majors is, would these classes be too much given what I\\'m already scheduled for? What is CEE 320 like in terms of course load? Is it a lot to handle? A little? Any advice would be appreciated.\\n\\nMy other option would be to take a general science elective such as GEOL 107, GEOL 118, or ATMS 120. If anyone has any input about one of these classes, that would be appreciated too. Thanks!That would be a great idea but he’s a bum and isn’t going to school and works like 1 day a week.

But your honor I heard that drinking salt water is good for me while I play baseball.Can you PM me about your experience with Schizophrenia? [deleted]Did they do the same for you?Absolutely. So I went to UIUC in 2012 for undergrad in Math &amp; CS, paying for it completely out of my own pocket (loans) plus some need and merit based scholarships. \\n\\nAfter sophomore year, I got a software engineering internship at a startup that was then acquired by a Fortune 500 company. Since I made a bit of money, nearly all my aid was revoked. \\n\\nNaturally, stress about paying for next year’s tuition took a heavy toll on my grades. At the same time, the CS department was bursting at the seams and unable to provide the same quality CS education that the university has been known for historically (massive wait lists, people sitting on the floor in lectures, etc.). Speaking to my advisors or even the dean of my college was no use. All my dean cared about was keeping her graduation rate up so she wanted me to switch into something “easier.” I told her to fuck off. I know what I’m supposed to be and I’m supposed to be a software engineer. With or without your stupid piece of paper. \\n\\nSo after my first semester of junior year, I called up the company I worked for and asked if I could just come work immediately for the same offer that they were giving other new grads. They said absolutely as I kicked ass and clearly demonstrated that I had the necessary skills and then some. \\n\\nSo, here I am over 3 years later. I worked at the big cushy Fortune 500 for a few years and now I’m at another startup founded by some people from the previous startup that was acquired. I’m making just as much, oftentimes more, than many of my degreed peers. What really matters is confidence, passion, and dedication. Plus, now that I’ve got several years experience, employers really don’t care about the degree. It’s literally never been an issue in any interview I’ve had.\\n\\nI hope that provided some insight. If anyone is reading this and experiencing similar difficulties, feel free to reach out. I do not believe there is a manufacturing engineering degree here at UIUC. There are industrial and mechanical engineering degrees that can get you a job as a manufacturing engineer though. I don\\'t think anyone besides yourself can say if you should do it since that comes down to cost,  your ability to learn, and where you see yourself in the future.

For me it was playing games of Halo/CoD with friends/dormmates and partying on occasion. \\n\\nIdk how organized you are now, but it REALLY helped me to start using Reminders and Calendar on my laptop/phone. That way, I never had to \"remember\" what homework I had to do, I just looked at my list.

There are plenty of studies showing that physical exercise is a great way to relieve stress.  I\\'m not saying you need to go to the ARC and get fit.

Thanks for taking the time to reply about this! I would presume as a CS faculty you have much more knowledge about this, however, I did want to make some points. \\n\\n1) That makes sense about people having poor experience with taking CS 173 with ECE 220 (many first time programmers have enough trouble with ECE 220, it is a hard class). \\n\\nHowever, at the same time, I think it\\'s unfair that many ECEs who\\'re interested in programming have to wait until 2nd semester sophomore year or 1st semester junior year (depending on if they have enough knowledge / a good enough advisor coming in to take ECE 120 first, some advisors recommend ECE 110 first) to take a core class (CS 225) while CS majors can take it first semester sophomore year. \\n\\nI think there are a few solutions to this. \\n1) Make CS 173 more easily available either over the summer or winter so that those who want to get ahead can. Given that a significant portion of the content is already online, some people might not be comfortable taking a proficiency, but I see no reason why the course itself can\\'t be online. \\n\\n2) Create a separate version of 173 that covers the required theory for CS 225 but is designed to be done in conjuction with the order in which ECE 220 goes. I think this solution is actually one of the best. \\n\\n3) Don\\'t change 225 (the class worked perfectly fine for a decade before this w/ Cinda, I\\'m not sure why there\\'s a need or desire to make it more theory heavy now). \\n\\nAs an add on, I would disagree with the fact that there\\'s been a lot of advance warning and would say that most people I know were caught by surprise. It\\'s always been paper knowledge that CS 173 was a prereq / coreq to 225 but no one I\\'ve talked to (i.e. students) expected 173 to be an enforced prereq to 225 and certainly not any freshman registering for classes last semester who could have taken MATH 213. \\nBecause social smarts/skills ≠ academic smarts/skills?u/zillescWhen it first started the questions were a lot harder.

Even removing the partisan components from the hearings, clearly he is not fit to be in the highest judicial power for life.

My heart breaks for all our classmates, professors, staff and community members who are relieving pain of their own, who are feeling they don’t matter and the government doesn’t care in a city that is staying silent in the mist of this. Protesting only goes so far, you must vote and be an active participant of democracy but protest is also an act of solidarity.

To achieve that, I try and keep as few barriers as possible between anyone and the course material.  All of the lecture slides and notes are public, all of the source code is available to anyone with a NetID, and the only resources that are restricted to enrolled students are resources that either I cannot legally release (echo360 videos, for example) or that take staff time away from enrolled students (labs, office hours, piazza).\\n\\nI thrive to create a CS 225 experience where you\\'ve got a lot of ways to find help IRL or on piazza (and as quickly as possible, knowing it gets worse as the deadlines get closer).

Ask them how they arrived where they are, and if they think it is where they will \"end up.\" The value of someone\\'s life based on a college degree is a pretty strong statement -- honestly I\\'d recommend re-watching Chuck Palahniuk\\'s \"Fight Club\" and considering his commentary on defining yourself only by earning potential; \"You are not your fucking khakis\" et al. It\\'s a good reminder that human connection and finding yourself are worthwhile. Definitely still apply. There are some majors in engineering that are less competitive than others and there are also a couple of scholarship programs within engineering for students who came from disadvantaged backgrounds or who might have not had the same HS opportunities everyone else had (not saying that\\'s you, but just saying these programs exist.) Plus, if you don\\'t get into your major you can still get into DGS.I’ve got a bass and a shitty amp let’s goooo dude &lt;3 the good news is I graduated! The bad news is I’m still too busy.

I\\'m sure most of us have seen people \"rip some fat clouds\" in a classroom or bathroom at some point. What people do on their own free time is fine, but there are people who are obnoxious about it and do it in places they shouldn\\'t be. Most places on University property tend to be places you shouldn\\'t be vaping anyway. Also, lowering the number of visible vaping on campus will probably make it seem less normalized and make fewer people more likely to do it. At least by University logic. ThisWell some \"interesting people\" will not set up a meeting to speak with you unless you are credentialed in some way or you have some kind of cred such that they understand the motive. So I might mention a well known and interesting person who lives and works here but you would need to sell them on the idea that they should sit down for an interview with them. So if you do not already have a blog with some writing samples you should probably get something out there so they can check you out. But for practice you could try going to places like the DI offices or WILL studios and speak with people who already do interviews - and interview them. Or go to the IMC in Urbana (IMC is about a mile east of campus) and speak to folks who publish The Public I. Or hook up with folks at Smile Politely and see what is being done and how you might augment what is being done in town already.

You really should go ask your advisor.  \\n\\n\\nAs one myself, I\\'d ask you how you\\'re feeling about the actual content of the course, rather than the grade you\\'re getting. Do you feel confident in the material covered? Would you be able to rely on this knowledge moving forward with other courses that use calculus? Would you benefit from retaking the course in order to have a better grasp on the material, or are you solely concerned about your grade?  \\n\\n\\nIn terms of your GPA, how are the rest of your courses going? If you\\'re getting all As and Bs, one C+ won\\'t wreck your overall GPA. If, instead, you\\'re pouring all your energy into the class at the expense of the other courses you\\'re taking and your entire performance in this semester is suffering because of it, then yeah, dropping might be an ok option. But honestly, the answers to these questions and more would determine how I\\'d advise you to proceed-- and that\\'s why I suggest going to your advisor\\'s office and asking them, so they can have this conversation with you and help you determine the best course of action.[deleted]The instructors haven’t been updatedI told them about how Ive always wanted to be an engineer, I went to competitions and won, had excellent project, had solid gpa and act.

It is defined as the cardinality of the largest set of points that the algorithm can shatter. It was originally defined by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis.Formally, the capacity of a classification model is related to how complicated it can be. For example, consider the thresholding of a high-degree polynomial: if the polynomial evaluates above zero, that point is classified as positive, otherwise as negative.\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Sauer–Shelah lemma**\\n\\nIn combinatorial mathematics and extremal set theory, the Sauer–Shelah lemma states that every family of sets with small VC dimension consists of a small number of sets. It is named after Norbert Sauer and Saharon Shelah, who published it independently of each other in 1972. The same result was also published slightly earlier and again independently, by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis, after whom the VC dimension is named.  In his paper containing the lemma, Shelah gives credit also to Micha Perles, and for this reason the lemma has also been called the Perles–Sauer–Shelah lemma.Buzaglo et al.\\n\\n***\\n\\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/UIUC/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28Did you actually live there?UIUC has what amounts to a zombie mascot though, with a history of divisiveness around it. \\n\\nNot having a mascot from forever ago is different.\\nThis is gonna get shitposted real hard I can feel it in my spoopy skelebones \\\\^\\\\^ I am also wondering this cuz I want a single in Daniels tooCheck out this bike rider everybodyI was involved in many student orgs in my fm&amp;sopho years, but I still felt lonely and Great Depression often time. \\nIt was not until junior year when I find my group now that I truly enjoy and belong to. \\nWhat I want to say is, loneliness takes place in majority’s lives, single or in a relationship, alone or being a part of network, even those who have a family.

I had a sub 3.9 GPA. You would think I am exaggerating, but I am not. If you don\\'t get into the schools you want to, it won\\'t be because of your GPA. It would even go further to say that when it came down to you and another applicants, your GPAs would not even be used to break ties. Admission committees in top-10 schools (lower-ranked schools have to look at GPAs to filter out under-qualified students) truly don\\'t give a shit about your GPA once it\\'s above 3.6. I will give you that it matter more if the class you are taking is also the area that you declare in your application, but otherwise optimizing for GPA is almost pointless.Yo your tweaking, FAR dining hall is terrible, especially compared to IKE. It was in one of the lounges around the lobby area between the two dormsI went abroad to South Korea in spring 2017. Because I was learning korean, I found a host family to stay with. I’d recommend this if you are learning the country’s language (although, check with the program to make sure they allow you to stay somewhere else besides the dorms). However, depending on where want to go, it is doable to find a 6 month apartment lease if that is what you want. You just have to look (e.g. I had a friend in Korea who stayed in an apartment with a six month lease).\\n\\nBut the easiest option (i.e. less work) would be to stay in the dorms.

Let me start by sharing a couple sites that have been published for FSHN 120:**\\n\\n* Learn more about FSHN 120: [https://publish.illinois.edu/nutrition-fshn120/consider120/](https://publish.illinois.edu/nutrition-fshn120/consider120/)\\n* Frequently asked questions for FSHN 120: [https://publish.illinois.edu/nutrition-fshn120/fshn-120-faq/](https://publish.illinois.edu/nutrition-fshn120/fshn-120-faq/)\\n\\n**Although I love teaching both the traditional and online sections, below are my insights as you decide which section is best for you as a student:**\\n\\n**TRADITIONAL 16-WEEK (section A - CRN 32987)**\\n\\n* The traditional section for spring 2019 provides guided learning walking you through the topics in a manner that sets you up for success with mini assessments due each week that providing valuable feedback comfortably getting you ready to master the exams.\\n* Although attendance is optional (not required), students gain valuable insight into the topic with a dynamic lecture/discussion format while earning extra credit iClicker points for coming to class.\\n* The traditional 16-week section encourages students to explore to topic on campus while earning extra credit (ex: alcohol awareness event).\\n* If students want to earn an \"AH\" on their transcripts, we have an amazing James Scholar Honors project working with the NCAA athletes with either a hands-on nutrition internship or behind-the-scenes activities. This option is not available to online students.\\n* Interested students enrolled in the traditional section could have an opportunity to be part of the teaching team in future semesters.\\n* If it fills prior to your time ticket, you will need to be put on a wait list by visiting: [https://fshn.illinois.edu/undergraduate/waitlist](https://fshn.illinois.edu/undergraduate/waitlist)\\n\\n**ONLINE 8-WEEK (section B - CRN 57561)**\\n\\n* The online section for spring 2019 is accelerated covering 16 weeks of material in 8 short weeks. If you are a seasoned online learner who can prioritize your coursework and get ahead of deadlines, this may be a good fit for you to get 3 credit hours of a science class in 8 weeks.\\n* If you are studying abroad, the online format may be the only option for you to take FSHN 120 in spring.\\n* If you really enjoy diving in and discussing \"hot topics\" in nutrition, the online section may be the better option as it is expected that you actively participate in the discussion online throughout the week.\\n* Due to the accelerated online nature of the online class, there are fewer opportunities for extra credit compared to the traditional section.\\n* As of October 31st 2018, there was only one seat left in the online section. The online section is on track to fill before November 2nd. If it fills prior to your time ticket, you will need to be put on a wait list by visiting: [https://fshn.illinois.edu/undergraduate/waitlist](https://fshn.illinois.edu/undergraduate/waitlist)\\n\\n**Let me know if you have any other questions...I am here to help!**\\n\\n**Toni Burkhalter**\\n\\n**499 Bevier Hall**\\n\\n[**Burkhalt@Illinois.edu**](mailto:Burkhalt@Illinois.edu)This is just... wrong?\\n\\nThe coldest it has ever been here is [25 below](http://www.intellicast.com/Local/History.aspx?location=USIL0209), and that was almost 20 years ago....

If everyone followed this mindset and did not go to commercial places to study unless they planned to buy an item every hour (which, I don\\'t believe is the case for the majority of people), the business would ultimately lose more money from enforcing policies such as this.

These companies are like kuka, yaskawa, fanuc, and UR. Ive seem kuka give a lot of research money and UR is a newish company so they may be breaking the model. You will need a BS to work for these companies.\\n\\nI can think of a few companies that are doing innovative work by utilizing the industrial robots, but dont make the robots and I honestly beleive these companies are a better choice since youd be working on new problems rather than trying to slowly innovate an old one. Try looking at lifefoundry here at UIUC for an example. Once again a BS should be good enough to work for these companies.\\n\\nResearch robotics id apply to academia, amazon, fetch robotics, irobots, toyota, and many other companies. Its kinda hard to put a blanket statement on research robotics since it varies a lot more than the industrial robotics industry. The only thing that I can say in general is that you will need to go to grad school to work in this area. The research robotics company cultures tend to look a lot like academia. This means you may have to travel to conferences, read and write papers, and work with others on research. Try looking at job listings for some of the companies I mentioned to get an idea of whats going on and what these companies want to hire.Guys, quit bitching at each other.

If it\\'s prereq to other courses he needs to take, e.g. in his major.    A C-level understanding in an early course usually means you\\'ll be in big trouble 2 courses later.    Much less painful to firm up your knowledge.    Better if you can take a different related course, but sometimes the only good option is retaking the same course.So I guess it\\'s somewhat hard to understand from where your issues are coming, when there are more opportunities than ever to do more academic activities through the math department. If you just want to do math 24/7, then [there are ways to do that](https://math.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/student-organizations-and-journals) (not to mention the outreach sector of the Illinois Geometry Lab, which isn\\'t even listed there). And if your goal is to make friends in the math department, then why should every social event have to be related to math? If you\\'re new then you may not know it, but the number of undergraduate social events through the math department was severely lacking in the past, the folks in MATRIX are a large part of why these things exist at all. If you keep your mind and eyes open, I\\'m sure that you can find plenty of events through MATRIX and beyond that will pique your interest, but claiming that MATRIX is \"really bad now\" just because they don\\'t have the events you want seems a bit unfair, don\\'t you agree? ;)Any more information?

Ive made women ORGASM and have SEX when I tell them i\\'m in cs at uiucI kinda understand how you feel. I actually just recently switched out of engineering into astronomy. My parents reacted pretty negatively, especially because I only let them know after the fact. My best advice is to trust yourself. Your parents only want what they believe is best for you; their intentions are not bad. But if you feel that astronomy is what you want to do, then follow through. Being stuck with someone you don’t enjoy isn’t as bearable as it sounds. My grades ended up tanking because I simply wasn’t enjoying myself in engineering.

The term \"mindfulness” is derived from the Pali term  sati, \"memory,\" \"retention,\" \"mindfulness, alertness, self-possession,\" which is a significant element of Buddhist traditions, while the concept is related to Zen, Vipassanā, and Tibetan meditation techniques. While \"mindfulness\" has been translated and interpreted as \"bare cognition,\" in a Buddhist context it has a wider meaning and purpose, related to vipassana, namely discerning what is beneficial and what is not, and calming the mind by this discernment. Individuals who have contributed to the popularity of mindfulness in the modern Western context include Thích Nhất Hạnh (1926 – ), Herbert Benson (1935 – ), Jon Kabat-Zinn (1944 – ), and Richard J. Davidson (1951 – ).Clinical psychology and psychiatry since the 1970s have developed a number of therapeutic applications based on mindfulness for helping people experiencing a variety of psychological conditions.\\n\\n***\\n\\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/UIUC/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28peach schnapps and some off brand blue liqueur &gt; Gimme a CS paper describing an algorithm or whatever.

We\\'re all on the same trainThe CS department doesn\\'t require GRE scores? That\\'s surprising. \\n\\nIn the Civil department, they list the *average* GRE scores of admitted students here: [https://cee.illinois.edu/admissions/graduate/admission-requirements-and-process](https://cee.illinois.edu/admissions/graduate/admission-requirements-and-process) \\n\\nVerbal: 155, Analytical: 165, Writing: 4.0. The graduate program in civil engineering is consistently ranked No. 1 or No. 2 in the nation, and so, those numbers are probably a good baseline for you. Basically, they don\\'t care so much about your English ability, and so, you need to have a high Analytical score. I think my scores were a little unusual for an engineering major... I got like a 165 in Verbal, a 162 in Analytical, and a 4.0 in writing...and I still got admitted. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBasically, the GRE is only one piece of the puzzle. You\\'ll still have your academic history, your personal statement, work history, Professional Engineer exam results (not applicable to CS, probably), and whatever else. And so, if your GRE scores are in the ballpark listed by CEE, I\\'d say it\\'s probably a good idea to include them. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow my personal opinion: The GRE is a complete waste of time, and does nothing more than provide admissions personnel evidence that you\\'re willing to spend money and time to test yourself on high-school math and obscure English words. The content of the GRE is completely irrelevant to most STEM disciplines...I mean, if you don\\'t understand high-school math, you wouldn\\'t have received your undergrad degree. I would understand if they required successful passing of the Fundamentals of Engineering exam for a particular discipline, or something...but, the GRE is just stupid. Having said that, my Analytical score is somewhat low for an Engineer...I think most people in my department (especially international students) tend to have near perfect scores on the analytical section. I was the outlier that drove down the average. Weird flex but ok\\n\\nAlso nobody said you had a penis??? I don\\'t get itThe community libraries are great, but close at 9.

From what he said we would be fine taking the class with no biology classes, if we really want to work in it, you can probably take 1 or 2 bio classes without even declaring a minor.\\n\\nSuch is the case with most subfields of cs. Don\\'t be fooled, you can easily learn all the bio and cs you need with just a cs major, same for AI, HCI and any other interdisciplinary field of cs. All the schools that offer specific \"computational biology\" majors are just trying to draw you in.

You sound like you have made an error, but you are considering doing something wrong by keeping quiet about it until somebody else catches you.  Bad plan.  Don\\'t do that.\\n\\nIf you believe you have done something that others may view as unethical (such as cheating), the best thing to do is to be proactive.  Give an account of what you did.  If some of the actions seem questionable, give an explanation for any questionable actions of your reasoning for why you took those actions.  Then describe the consequences - the observations that you are seeing now that lead you to believe you have accidentally helped someone cheat.  (I saw their code after grading and it was the same as mine... whatever).

Part of city walking is just understanding that people are NEVER going to stop biking on the sidewalk no matter how many times you say it. Just deal with it and go around them. \\n\\nHmm...I stood in the bike lane, yet I am a bicyclist.  There\\'s plenty of space on that sidewalk too.  I made a point to stand still so my movement were predictable.  You could easily go around, yet you\\'re so focused and rule-following that you insist on riding someone\\'s official bike lane markings.  I assume you attend the university.  I assume you\\'re intelligent.  No one cares if you lean to the side to navigate around a stationary object in your path.  No one but you.  Because those line tell you must travel along that path and that path only.  I stood there, completely still, completely motionless, completely predictable.  Three other bicyclists managed to maneuver around me.  How hard is that?  You don\\'t even exert force.  You let your bodyweight tilt to one side.  The others moved around me easily enough.  But you.  But you had to make more of a show about it like it was some awesome effort on your part.  Aren\\'t you paying attention?  Are you as bad as the people walking around not paying attention on your phone?  Did I catch you offguard and jump out like a rooted tree would?  You had to make a big show of it like it was effort and yell at me, \"This is the bike lane!\"  You think I didn\\'t know where I was standing?    Yeah I wanted to be a few feet closer to the street.  Was there anyone around blocking the rest of the sidewalk?  No.  There was practically no one around.  It\\'s a freaking painted strip on a very wide sidewalk.  But it\\'s the bike lane and you so anal you have to remind anyone who touches it.  I saw a post this morning that had a good term for it.  Hall monitor.  You\\'re a freaking a hall monitor ready to narc out anyone.  You are intelligent.  You did make it into the university.  But you lack a bit of common sense and awareness of the real world.  So to you I say, fuck you.  I knew damn well where I was standing.  You can easily go around.  It\\'s no effort on your part.  If I can I\\'ll do it again just to spite you.  So fuck you.  I say that as a bicyclist myself.   Because I can move around a person and it\\'s very easy to predict where a non moving object is going.  I don\\'t adhere to the rules but there only a general guideline and only really matter when the sidewalk actually is packed with people.  So fuck you.Won’t let me joinNot very good.

I just don\\'t find myself caring as much. Friends are just a way to temporarily engage in human interaction, and not a whole lot more, at least to me. Never really seemed to serve any higher purpose; no friend has ever ridden to my rescue, nor stood up for me, nor made me a better person, despite my best attempts to do those things for them.\\n\\n4) I need an internship because the other option is being home, with my drug-addict brother and parents that constantly fight with said brother. I need an internship because, for once in my goddamn life, I want to work on real problems. I need an internship so that I can say \"Look!

Some luck out an meet people in the dorms who become life long friends. Others meet those people via classes or organizations they join. Scott is in a busy area of campus with long to of students and the rec center next door.  Some prefer the other side of campus and choose Allen Hall as it also has a athletic center (place to work out)  next door but is also adjacent to a more typical small town neighborhood.  I assume the roommate match system will try to match you with another second year student where ever you live. That will be handy if you have a roommate who knows campus and the towns a bit.  First year on campus for transfer students can be a challenge so being with others may be helpful so you can share in the struggle. So Scott might be good from that perspective.

I thought it was fine overall. The definite downsides are that it is fairly expensive for a cheaply built apartment (the walls are super thin and don’t block any sound, the doors had substantial drafts, the paint was builders paint so don’t put any adhesives on it). They also try to rip you off on the security deposit.

The 1st amendment protects the freedom of the press to publish what they wish, so long as it doesn’t constitute libel or slander, both of which have solid legal definitions that Trump can’t change. The idea that Trump calling out the media for fake/partisan/badly researched reporting somehow constitutes an attack on the freedom of the press is ludicrous. That is because the first amendment also protects our right to criticize the press.

Four years into owning my car, I noticed that the antifreeze level was low, and I added more.... then discovered that one of the mechanics had double-threaded my coolant tank itself (damaged it by forcing the cap on wrong) and now the cap would not screw back on correctly.

They told me that with two hours labor it would be $120 plus $75 for the part itself.\\n\\nWith no remorse over damaging my tank, I would say that although I have been taking my car to Champaign Ford City, I cannot recommend them.The indigenous people smoking the peace pipe with the colonizers, 1645 (colorized)I’m not sure to be quite honest, but others could answer that question!

Many students in MechSE have had better luck working personal connections to find internships. Make a list of your family and friends -- who works in manufacturing, industrial farming, software, etc?

You actually learn amazing shit in all of your classes. Econ is an absolute snooze-fest. I want to add a couple things wrt friends and peers.\\n\\n1. Try not to have ECE/coursework as your *only* connection between those friends, or else the friendship will feel tenuous at best (i.e., ending when mutual classes end) and cheap at worst (i.e., just using each other for homework/studying help). It\\'s honestly not that hard to extend your friendship beyond just coursework and the major but it does require some effort, and the onus may fall on you to be that glue guy in your friend group. And it doesn\\'t have to be big things - I\\'ve found that a lot of people in ECE default to asking something along the lines of, \"How was that homework/exam/class\", rather than something more humanistic like \"How are you doing?\" It\\'s the small things that make the friendships meaningful and real.\\n\\n2. I would recommend not letting ECE dominate your life to the point where it completely takes over your social sphere, as in, make meaningful friendships outside of the department too. It\\'s draining when every conversation regresses into one about coursework or internships or research. Yes, it\\'s good to have friends who commiserate with you, but do you really want your life devolve into doing 385 labs, then going home and complaining about 385 labs? \\n\\nAnyways, there are awesome people in this department (just look at the people who took the time to comment in this thread) and awesome things to do here.

[Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM5wNpK3nX4)I oof’d on the last 2 questions Tell me more about thisHey so I\\'m a phd student who busted his dick to get into his program, and finally after the first year of exams and weeding-out hell, I get to teach you guys. Alongside that teaching are office hours. I get to be in front of a classroom for 50 minutes each Friday with you, and have a couple hours a week in my office where I\\'m ready to answer your question. I (and we) have been working years to get to this point. We\\'re chomping at the bit to finally get to teach you something. Do you have any idea how much every graduate TA in my department (and many others) are *dying* to see you guys in office hours? We love our subjects. Most of us love teaching. Having you there, telling us you\\'re lost and don\\'t know where to begin... that\\'s exactly what we can help with!! Of course, it\\'d be difficult to repeat the entire lecture, but understand that most TAs have been in your position at one point. The only thing we talk shit about is when a student doesn\\'t seek out help and also fails in the end; if you sought help and fail, that\\'s a very high honor. There is no shame in that at all. But more likely than not, if you seek help consistently and followup on your end of the deal (studying at home) diligently, you will not fail.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHere\\'s what I suggest: you don\\'t want to walk into office hours just asking to be taught things in general. Go through your notes / the text (chronologically probably makes the most sense, but whatever works for you), and find the first thing that confuses you. Even if it\\'s on page 1. Go in with a specific question, even about something simple. Giving us a specific question shows you\\'re actually concerned with learning the material; if you have nothing in specific to ask, it seems more like you\\'re worried about the grade rather than the learning process.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo have a question. If it\\'s on page 1, great. Maybe prepare ahead of time what you know you\\'ll have questions about. If the answer to that is \"everything\", highlight the most concerning aspects. You can sidetrack and say \"what about this?\" \"what about that?\" and that\\'s great! Having many questions is totally okay.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOne of the biggest issues students have adjusting from high school to college (not saying you\\'re a freshman, but assuming you\\'ve never been to office hours I\\'m venturing a guess) is understanding that the responsibility to learn is placed more on you. Parents aren\\'t involved; profs rarely care if they have too many students (but even then, they like to see you in office hours as well usually). This means seeking out the many resources the university provides, such as office hours. Give them a shot. If a PhD or master\\'s student can\\'t explain the intro content to you in a way that you understand, seek out help from a classmate who may be willing to help. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAll the best my guy or gal. Take care of yourself and your education!Bro you’re fine. I can’t even survive in classes that start with 1If you do it through the app, you get a free ride one they check out the problem.Life ruined? Guy probably gets a misdemeanor charge. Calm yourself. &lt;/3I definitely understand the frustration that you\\'re going through - the TAM department here has drawn much personal ire from me, and some of my earliest posts are complaining about 251. \\n\\nThe best that I can say is, yes the class sucks, but it gets better. Well, at least not 210, but I found that 211 and 251 were much more forgiving on their CBTF. 212 Is much easier, what you get on the homework is what you get on the exam (typically). 251 was in the middle, you needed to know the homework in and out, but honestly the problems were not that difficult, at least compared to what I remember in 211. In addition, I think a semester of taking CBTF exams prepared me for it.\\n\\nWhile I have little personal evidence to suggest this, I think the TAM department is probably, without a doubt, the laziest and careless department I\\'ve encountered. Numerous times I remember people begging for extensions on homework in 251, some of which were actually granted - but they circumstances in which they were asked (such as lectures being later than due dates) made almost obvious students would need them, since they did not have enough time to properly learn the material. It is also my personal belief that the reason they have CBTF and Prairelearn is that they honestly couldn\\'t bothered to grade something by hand and would rather delegate it to the machine, despite the stress it causes on the student to perform.\\n\\nI\\'m not here to make an argument about whether or not it\\'s acceptable for students to make mistakes on the exam when such mistakes could be life or death - but I will say that often times you will be working as a team, and not under a 50 minute crunch time with no computer or anyone to help, and also that even NASA fucked up and wasted a Mars landing simply because they forgot to change units between Imperial and Metric at one point...\\n\\nThe best advice I can give you is to do the prairelearn in and out. Don\\'t ever leave a problem that you don\\'t know unsolved. Go to office hours, get help, write down how to do exactly every single problem (with generic variables), study it and practice it, you\\'ll get at least a B in everything on the CBTF. This strategy personally led me to get an A- in all three courses.\\n\\nGood luck. Thanks for the information. \\nI\\'m a little bit stressed out after finding this out, I just want to have a confirmation so could I start figuring what should I do.

If you\\'re feeling overwhelmed why not consider dropping your research or online course?

If the issue is that you\\'re just doing too much this semester then they will tell you to drop your nonrestricted courses first.\\n\\nIf I\\'m wrong please correct me but that\\'s my understanding of dropping restricted courses.I use this and I love it https://www.tigrlock.com , titanium bike lock Call them.

I sadly had to drop that course due to lack of time.\\n\\nHonestly I think a large part of it is getting used to the workload, but from my current standpoint, I don’t see much ec involvement.

Sometimes you need both, or sometimes only talk therapy helps, you’ll need to figure out which one’s true for you. \\nBesides meds and therapy, keeping up with exercise and eating right can be helpful.

The material in CS 241 was not that challenging for me, and I was in fact interested in the material, but the course was still a drag when I took it as a sophomore.

However, the people who hang out in ACM are a very small subset of the people in ACM, which is a somewhat small subset of the people in the CS program. As a result, there are some individuals there that actively act like they own the place, which comes off very badly to me. Now when I go there, I can always find a couple of people in 126/173, and it\\'s nice to chat for a bit and then leave. I don\\'t think most of these people (I can think of one or two people who are doing this) are solely in the office to schmooze with upperclassmen, most are just their trying to do some work, interact with some people, and kill some time between classes. If it\\'s not your thing to study in ACM, don\\'t bother. But there are definitely some kind upperclassmen, who will help explain git to a complete newbie (despite being \"ahead\" in 126/173, which honestly means nothing, some of us (like me) are pretty inept). And a lot of the other people in 126/173 are down to earth, and always willing to talk. I\\'d like to think of some of them as my closest new friends in college. In the end, it\\'s college, so just interact with the people who seem to be down to earth, and actually respect others. You don\\'t have to associate with ACM (at least for now) or with the people who overmarket themselves, and will lose almost nothing from it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI think there\\'s a reason a lot of CS upperclassmen will say their biggest regret is not making more friends from other majors. Sure, many of the CS majors are similar, have similar interests, and like to interact with each other because of that. But there are a lot of interesting people, and some of my upperclassmen acquaintances described how most of their friends aren\\'t engineers. It depends what kind of school you\\'re talking about. At CMU, everyone takes CS classes, and many are trying to transfer into SCS there, according to some of my friends. As a result, people in CS somewhat look down on others, and it\\'s a very cutthroat environment. Similarly, at GATech, CS is also key, and there are tons of people trying to get in, with some superiority expressed by majors. But my friend at Harvard in CS was talking about how most all of the majors are viewed equally, and there aren\\'t any elitists pursuing STEM or liberal arts (although Harvard has its own host of superiority complex problems I would think). But at UIUC, there\\'s the **perceived** hierarchy of CS &gt; engineering &gt; school. And CS is big here. It\\'s a very well branded, successful department, but that\\'s not an experience specific to just us. Other schools with well funded, strong CS departments suffer from similar issues.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI appreciate that you say that \"some of my fellow CS freshman aren\\'t like that,\" because it is a minority of people who come off as jerks. And I know for example, that I am sometimes super excited about a solution that I\\'ve implemented, and will tell everyone who cares to listen (and a couple that don\\'t). But rather than actively trying to brag or flex on others, it\\'s more of the satisfaction gained from succeeding, and wanting to share my excitement. So in a biased fashion, I will say don\\'t be so quick to judge those who seem to enjoy talking about their solutions? Because for those of us that have little passion for CS right now, it\\'s wholesome and good to get excited about it.I really didn’t expect so many mature answers, thank you all so much for your inputYou are a beautiful human being, thank you so much.

I taught a robot to follow a tape path on a table my first year, and fell in love with robotics.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs an EE major, I chose to take a lot of classes related to computer engineering - I believe I could have traded one or two classes around and graduated with a CE degree if I had wanted.  If you want to put \"wrote an operating system\" on your resume, there\\'s a class that will teach you to do that (and assign it as a graded project) here.  Many of the classes will be demanding of your time.  I tended to drop out of all extracurricular activities after the first month off each semester, and would join back up again at the start of the next semester.

I suspect that two wings into an interview with [/u/seanseaevans](https://www.reddit.com/u/seanseaevans) I would develop a serious case of the hiccups which might last for several days. (Actually it might not take two wings.)Sorry that this is off topic but how useful is this class? I was thinking about taking it next semester I\\'m just really stressed out right now, I\\'m hoping that someone locks it for me. If not though I might just have to wait until their office next opens to contact them and just pay like the 100 dollars that it\\'s gonna be from the racked up bike time and their service fee for closing the bike for you./r/uiucswaphttps://imgur.com/a/vEMz3vTEven if you don’t know what’s going on in class, you better still be paying attention. Go to every office hour you can because it’s easier for them to explain it to you than to figure it out yourself. I was like you before and I still am somewhat. I developed heavy social anxiety and couldn’t even talk to people without being nervous. You have to realize that your mental health is as equally important as your education. You probably feel guilty for going out instead of studying right? You have to sacrifice time to socialize otherwise you’re going to burn out quickly. If you can, I would go to the library or something to study. It’s extremely easy to feel depressed because you’re stuck at home all day. It’s important to see that you don’t have to socialize everyday, even a little time a week is good enough. Join an rso or go workout with a buddy. Fix it before it’s too late. College isn’t all about studying, make it fun and something memorable.

They started doing some major renovations on our apartments toward the end of the lease, and dealing with some of the contractors was a pain in the dick (especially when they were constantly parking in our parking space), but that\\'s only sorta on JSM.\\n\\nMy major complaint is they tried to absolutely *fuck* us on the security deposit. It was a 1-bedroom, &lt;600 sqft apartment that I cleaned immaculately top to bottom, and they claimed nearly 7 fucking hours of work \"cleaning\" it, when all they actually did (according to the receipt they\\'re required to provide by law) was wipe off the counters (which I already did) and mop the floors again (which I already did). I eventually got my money back, but it took nearly two months of arguing with them and waiting on snail mail.  They definitely were trying to pull something hoping I just wouldn\\'t bother arguing it.\\n\\nI just looked up the place on JSM\\'s website too - I don\\'t think $650 is unreasonable based on the pictures/description. It\\'s a tad expensive, but so is just about everything on campus that isn\\'t a dump.

It is absurd to put archival collections below grade in this part of the state. Water is always going to want to get into that space. They will need to install major new HVAC upgrades as well as archival spaces need better climate controls than the Undergrad already has. I hope this is a balloon being floated and the reactions will lead them to move Archives elsewhere. The campus is trying to not build many more new buildings but rather re-purpose/re-use where possible to keep operating costs from continuously growing. So I get the concept of re-making these into new spaces. By the way they said they would retain the architectural details of the Main Library even if they do change its role. And of course these are proposals so most students on campus now will not be affected as the money has not been found/allocated as yet.

Thank you!Cyclist should also GTFO the sidewalkI was in a similar place last year. Depressed that I had no friends, no girlfriend, making no progress academically. There’s no easy cure. For me, I think getting out of it was more of changing the way I thought and realizing that some days will be better than others. Instead of agonizing over what what I didn’t have or wasn’t, focus on what I did have and change what I didn’t like about myself without going overboard. \\n\\nSocially, I didn’t have many friends and still don’t but that’s fine as long as I’m doing what I like. There’s no magic way to make friends. It just happens when you go out and have fun. I’d still also would like to get a girlfriend but I think that will just happen when it does. No reason to stress over it.\\n\\nAcademically, I was going in circles making no progress towards my thesis. A lot of people I talk to say they do better in school when they party or go out a lot and I can believe it. Work comes easier when you have yourself together. Don’t define your identity as being good at school. School is much less important than actually liking yourself in my opinion.\\n\\nOverall what helped me was first talking to my parents about everything. Voicing my anxieties just helped. Can’t explain why. Then, trying to change how I saw myself and going out by myself. I defined myself as someone who does well in school and doesn’t party so during my internship, I turned into a huge partier. Honestly I think getting away from Illinois and familiarity was huge too.\\n\\nIf you want a really good movie/series that deals with depression, Neon Genesis Evangelion is really good.

However, it\\'s really not something you have to deal with alone - in my freshman year, I quickly found other ECE peers who became my closest friends (and current roommates!) to accompany me on my \"journey\". Whatever technical classes that you will take in the future as an ECE student will undoubtedly be challenging and at some times overwhelming (dealing with the 385 blues rn) but deep down I do enjoy what I am learning and do not really mind the labs/projects/hw. Of course, I may be a minority in that sense but I do believe there is some truth in having to appreciate or at least have some sort of self-motivated interest in whatever you decide to major in. In other words, just because it is hard, it shouldn\\'t mean you can\\'t enjoy it. Perhaps I am polarizing ECE in the sense that you either love it or hate it but the truth is that you need to find something/subdiscipline within ECE that you are truly interested in (for me it\\'s embedded systems, digital logic design, FPGA\\'s!). So you don\\'t have to like everything from E&amp;M, semiconductors to microarchitecture, just explore around and see what you think you looks interesting (which is kinda what college is for anyways - finding your place). You might even find that ECE is not your thing and that\\'s OK!\\n\\nI guess that begs the response \"Even if you do enjoy ECE and spend all your time studying it, you basically don\\'t do anything else\". This is a hard one because it largely varies from person to person. I attended rigorous programs back in my middle and high school and I can surely say that it set a solid foundation of time-management skills and discipline that I still draw from today. Being able to micromanage my time wisely allows me to primarily allocate time for homework, but also for working out, playing Volleyball IM, participating in RSO\\'s, and occasional career surfing/technical side projects. Of course, being able to distribute time is an essential skill for every major, not just ECE, and I truly believe that if you have a good handle on it, you can achieve success.\\n\\nSo bottom line - find friends and peers who you can relate to your ECE struggles, definitely talk with peers/upperclassmen/advisors to help you find your niche if you haven\\'t already (it\\'s fine if you haven\\'t yet since you\\'re a freshman), manage time well, and most importantly, prioritize taking care of yourself (never neglect your mental/physical health and hygiene).\\n\\nSorry for the long-winded response ( I didn\\'t mean for this to come across as condescending) - I didn\\'t really address your concerns about a general feeling towards the uni but feel free to shoot me a PM if you still have any more thoughts or questions about my experiences!I\\'ve been there!

Not having much of a social life is tough, but you need to focus on yourself and your own wellbeing more than anything. Close friends in college are not necessary. There\\'s a 99% chance they won\\'t be in your life after college anyway. It is enough to have a circle of \"good friends\" whom you have things in common with.

No, but an aggressive lawyer *miiiight* be able to argue that calling out names to take attendance is a violation of FERPA.  FERPA  forbids me to confirm or deny that a particular student is registered for my class, even to other students in the class, without that student\\'s explicit permission—registration status is part of the student\\'s protected educational record.  Calling out names from the roster reveals that the named students are registered.  Forcing the named students to verify their presence, and therefore reveal their identity, only makes the situation worse.\\n\\nIt\\'s an interesting question whether announcing (truthfully) that I am enforcing the university\\'s policy limiting class attendance to registered students would violate FERPA.

If you get the CHEM 103 and 105 labs, then you would have the option to take CHEM 222 and 223 in the fall and not take the CHEM 202-205 sequence. However, that may or may not prepare you for the rigors of the chemistry you will take in organic chemistry. Since you would be coming in as a first-year student directly into CHBE, you would have to take CHBE 121. I would caution you about taking CHBE 221 and other technical courses too early. They are rigorous and take a significant amount and different kinds of study that are not typically found at the dual course or community college level.

You know that you\\'re at least hireable in a very financially stable job.  I also have been comforted by the fact that a lot of the adults in my life are able to be really happy without necessarily loving their jobs.  A lot of what you are concerned about seems to do with leaving college and everything you know and that\\'s understandable.  I would suggest if you have any trustworty older people in your life who have done this successfully, talk to them about it and see how they find happiness. That\\'s not the point lol.

I would encourage you to talk to your therapist and discuss a plan on dealing with your feelings and thinking patterns.  You cite that you are (at least partially) depressed over your grades, but your depression is likely causing your grades to worsen.  Until you are able to shore up your mental health, it is unlikely that your grades will improve substantially.\\n\\nThere is a Dean of Emergencies and an Ombudsman(or men) that help to handle these issues.  Your therapist can also be a powerful advocate.  I have encountered many students in similar situations who seek treatment.  Sometimes it\\'s counseling, sometimes it\\'s medication, sometimes it\\'s both, and sometimes it\\'s inpatient treatment.  In all of these situations, they have been able to return to classes, and most have done much better than before.\\n\\nWhat is the worst thing that could happen, realistically, by talking to your therapist?  Your therapist is probably your strongest ally right now, but they can only help if you are honest with them.\\n\\nEven if you do have to delay a semester, or even if you *do* get dismissed, there are other programs.  U of I is a decent school, but it\\'s not good enough to sacrifice your life over.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI had a similar-ish situation when I went to UIC.  I chose not to discuss it with my therapist, and in turn did not know of all the resources that were designed to help someone in that situation.  Instead, I waited until there was nothing possible to do.  The consequence of my inaction ultimately was having to leave school and work in a factory for some years.  That is similar to your \"worst case scenario\".  Even in that worst case, I can find strengths.  I ended up taking night classes while in the factory and earned some associate degrees.  I then started working elsewhere, and one thing leads to another, and I\\'m now several years into a career.  I was able to choose to return to UIUC to finish out my degree.\\n\\nHad I talked to my therapist, a lot of years of delay could have been avoided, probably.  I didn\\'t, but I did choose not to follow through with my plan.  And because of that choice, I have strengths, experiences, and knowledge that my peers don\\'t.\\n\\nMistakes and crisis are opportunities for growth.  Suicide does not allow it.

These algorithms can be used to give good average-case results (complexity-wise) to problems which are hard to solve deterministically, or display poor worst-case complexity. An algorithmic game theoretic approach can help explain why in the average case randomized algorithms may work better than deterministic algorithms.\\n\\n***\\n\\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/UIUC/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28You can try to wrench Halloween out of my cold, dead skeleton handsProbably because they need maps that show the actual entire system because in the end MTD is not just for campus.

However, people are also your coworkers and peers and I would argue more understanding. In ECE 391 if you don\\'t have something committed to Gitlab by 6 pm, you\\'re sorry out of luck. In the real world you have a deadline your aiming for but it\\'s not unusual, in fact it\\'s commonplace for deadlines to move around and priorities to change and you\\'ll have regular updates to measure where you\\'re at. \\n\\nMore so, you\\'re not expected to work all day everyday in industry the same way ECE @ Illinois expects you to work.

If you sent 10 emails, it sounds like you\\'re more interested in \"any kind of research\" than some particular field. Tbh the professors might be able to tell. Generally they want students with legitimate interest, and some kind of experience - classes, extracurriculars, personal projects, internships, whatever. And anyway, you have no idea if you enjoy something unless you try it.\\n\\nTry to get to know the professors in the area you want to work in. Take a class with with them, sit in front, ask questions, go to office hours now and then, show interest, and ask them about research near the end of the semester.\\n\\nIn the mean time, try to get some real experience building or modeling or testing something. I don\\'t know your major, but for example, if you\\'re in engineering or something related you can work on satellites with SatDev, or join Solar Car, Baja SAE, Student Space Systems, anything that gets you hands-on experience.  Doesn\\'t matter exactly what you major is, you \"learn on the job\" anyway. Also doesn\\'t matter that much if your experience is directly related to the professor\\'s research - you are showing you can start and finish a project and meet requirements and work with others. This is *much* more important than your grades in freshman-level classes.I always thought of that as nasty, but now thinking about it, it’s not nasty as all because the particles you eject in your cough were in your body anyways...\\n\\nCoughing on your food is about as unhealthy as not coughing on your food lolI second this opinion.

Gotcha.You seem to not understand that printing an opinion is not the same thing as endorsing it.

Should we just avoid all together or can we proceed with caution? Im hoping you say the later because it is a good balance of location/size/price that we all agree onI found 225 easier to get an A in since it gives so much extra credit (as you said). 233 isn\\'t that bad, either. It gives a small amount of EC, and as long as you study enough for the last couple exams (the hard ones) you should be on track for an A.

Target bought the landWhat classes are you getting the dual credit inFrom an article on Above the Law: \\n\\nYesterday the law school hosted a “#MeToo and Academia” panel discussion and the panel faced pointed questions about Kesan. One audience member noted Kesan “continues to have unfettered access to female students and research assistants,” and wanted to know why the law school was not doing more. Panelist and law professor Lesley Wexler said her “strong suspicion” was that tenure prevented harsher punishments.\\n\\n“If a private employer wants to fire someone found guilty of sexual harassment, that’s a much easier process,” Wexler said. The law school is part of the larger university system and is not able to “make its own decisions here” with regards to consequences for an alleged harasser.\\n\\n“That is part of the problem,” she said.\\n\\nWhen asked the follow up if Wexler was “personally satisfied” with the investigation’s result, she answered simply, “No.”Never worked for me eitherI don\\'t know . . . I went to the Counseling Center last year because I wanted to literally kill myself, and I found them to be super helpful.

Math\\'s tradition is to put names up fairly last-minute rather than put them up and then change them on you. With such a large teaching staff, and many who are qualified to teach many courses, we often have a quite a few late changes to the tentative teaching assignments.\\n\\nI don\\'t know anything about you, past courses/grades/etc, but if you\\'re a fairly typical math undergrad, we recommend taking Math 416, Math 417, and Math 444/447/424 in three different semesters for best results. Any of these would be fine with Math 442.\\n\\nSpring early registration itself runs from Oct. 29-Nov. 16, with veterans and honors students registering first, and the freshmen with the lowest number of credits registering around Nov. 16.Engineering has special rules about 100-level math classes not counting for graduation credit, I believe.

I mean on the topic of spying, they just discovered that a Chinese factory was installing a spy chip the size of a grain of rice in every motherboard that creates a universal back door into the system.

If there’s one thing I wish I could have told my 19 year old self, it would be that it’s ok to change your mind, it’s ok to pursue other interests, and it’s ok to take that time to decide.

You could go to class tomorrow in a purple beehive wig, a crop top that says \"I &lt;3 Anuses\", booty shorts, and sandals and socks, and the U of I at least, wouldn\\'t do a damn thing about it.  That\\'s just the nature of your modern day university, and to be honest, I have a bit of a problem with that.\\n\\nI certainly support an employer not hiring someone because they wore a crop top or a fursuit to an interview.  That just screams obnoxious, entitled, and maybe ignorant/naive.  But of course they should be able to wear whatever they want at their home.  The crux of this situation is that two strangers share a home.

Most instructors report suspected cases of academic integrity violations through the FAIR system. The student then has the chance to write a formal response. If the instructor then still affirms the suspected offense, they will suggest a sanction (consequence). Some of these are listed on a syllabus or are department policy, but most not. Then the student can accept the sanction or appeal. This is the process. Bro, I did it myself. My first ever oil change!

Bottom text[deleted]&gt; How are you in college as a 15 year old?\\n\\nThe short answer is, I developed fast (spoke my first word at 3 months), and my parents ran out of things to keep me learning with so they signed me up for an online program that accelerated me into being high school ready by the age of five, at which point the only high school equipped to handle me was a cyber school. I attended this cyber school, and ran out of STEM courses well before having enough credits to graduate. To fill the void and prevent myself from going stir-crazy I started taking MOOCs (massive open online courses) from top-tier universities. One of those MOOCs was an Android development course from UIUC\\'s own Dr. Lawrence Angrave. Angrave, as anyone who has taken a class from him can attest, is an awesome lecturer. A short time later my mother had a business conference in Chicago, and I asked him if my parents and I could come down to Urbana and visit. He said yes. I came. I fell in love with UIUC.\\n\\n&gt; And why do you keep referring to yourself in the third person?\\n\\nAre you referring to the bit where I said \"I, Q, have ...\"? I was intending to form a reference to the manga *JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken*.

I created nearly all of my [data driven discoveries](http://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/) with students who are **not** CS or ECE majors -- I\\'m almost certain one was political science (OP\\'s post history suggests this might be OP\\'s major).  I really put everything into making every course I teach fantastic and it\\'d be great to have you as part of that in the course I\\'m running for the first time (no prereqs and will be a future gen-ed, but counts for 400-level credit next semester only; I\\'m surprised we still have a lot of spots left): [http://courses.las.illinois.edu/spring2019/stat107/](http://courses.las.illinois.edu/spring2019/stat107/).\\n\\n...if you\\'re a major with a lot of computational background: I\\'ll also be doing CS 225\\'s honors section in Spring, too! :)I met someone with double majoring in stats with actuarial for her researchWhat does it mean to take the gradient of a multivalued function? It\\'s not obvious how one would go about that. How do you even write down a multivalued function? At each point there\\'s a whole bunch of different values to choose -- how would I find a derivative? You have to choose a \"local branch\", but how do I do that? Like, if I choose some value at a point in the domain, how do I know what the values nearby are? Why doesn\\'t it matter which \"local branch\" I choose? In reality, it does, unless you have a special multivalued function. To give an answer to all of these questions in a non-self-contradictory way requires more sophisticated math, from differential geometry and topology (\"closed and exact forms\" and \"covering spaces\" ). For calc 3, to work with these multivalued functions, you\\'d either have to add a whole bunch of extra math technology that no one understands, or say things that are not true, so we just avoid talking about it.Gamingare you majoring in mcb?It\\'s a product sold to people who have never heard of the word, \"truthiness\"no u If you aren\\'t dating on LON CAPA or Blackboard as well, are you even trying? 391 is a time sink so be aware of that when picking another tech class.

But don\\'t equate enjoying a course to ignoring anything you don\\'t like or aren\\'t good at.

If you can learn the stuff despite a low grade, you\\'ll do well in the long-run even if you have trouble finding your first job. If you don\\'t learn anything under the guise of not caring about grades, you are only hurting yourself. tbh i just wanted you to notice me :\\'( [deleted]Try “Referred to you by Professor ______”&amp; I spotted a weaboo who is probably also a furry ��Fair enough!It’s kind of crazy how all these gig economy apps do virtually no checking or evaluation of the applicants at all. These are food delivery, but I’ve been hired by Grubhub, UberEats, and DoorDash without talking to a single person from any of the companies, just had a background check and good to go. And whenever I’ve needed to call someone, it’s always some shitty call center in India or something. There’s no accountability.So the complex numbers are a natural two-dimensional extension of the real numbers. So naturally, it makes sense to ask what it would mean to take the derivative over complex numbers:\\n\\nf\\'(z) := lim_(h-&gt;0) (f(z+h)-f(z))/h\\n\\nIt turns out that differentiability in the complex numbers is a more strict requirement than differentiability in the reals. You see, that offset h is also a complex number, and it can approach 0 from any direction. So multivariable calculus limit stuff kicks in.\\n\\nIt turns out it\\'s so strict that if a function is differentiable, so is its derivative. (By induction, any function that is first differentiable is infinitely differentiable.) We call such functions HOLOMORPHIC if they are defined over the whole complex plane, and MEROMORPHIC if they are uniquely defined over all but a few points. (We\\'re getting to that \"uniquely defined\" bit, hang in there.)\\n\\nNow this automatically brings to mind Taylor series, right? So it turns out that a holomorphic/meromorphic function is entirely determined by the tiniest (2D) section of it. It turns out also, that a function is equal to its Taylor series wherever it is defined. This is NOT TRUE IN THE REALS, but it is in the complex numbers.\\n\\nSo now we\\'d really, really like to extend the domain of our Taylor series. A holomorphic function has all of C as its domain, but a meromorphic function\\'s radius of convergence is only the distance from the center of the Taylor series to its closest singularity. So we do a thing called analytic continuation, which is where we pick a point close to the edge of the radius of convergence, and make a new Taylor series there, and stitch the domains together. Boom, easy. z! (the factorial) is meromorphic and can be extended in this way.\\n\\nBut there\\'s some functions, like log z, where if you keep doing this, and you make a circle all the way around the singularity, the value at one end of the closed loop and the value at the other are different. Instead of trying to decide which of these is the right value (although we do call one the principal value), we say all values are valid, and we call these multivalued functions. So, for instance, over the reals we call log(1) = 0 but more accurately log(1) = 0 + 2πk for integer k. Over the reals we say sqrt(4) = 2 but in the complex numbers sqrt(4) = 2*(-1)^k for integer k (either 2 or -2 depending how you approach the point),\\n\\nThis idea, that a function can have different values depending how you approach the point, is what I was getting at in my original post.How long did you use it for?so far my college life has been procrastination and video games.[deleted]The worst part (well, for those who that did or are taking the class) was that rumours were going around that the administration is proposing to remove 315 from the CHBE curriculum...\\n\\nBut yes, this class is quite awful.You\\'re an asshole. \\n \\nThe bikeshare program is supposed to help the entire community with transportation.

If you are able to spend like 30 minutes a day doing homework or just writing code in general you’ll be fine. Otherwise if you’re a procrastinator like me you might want to get a friend that knows how to code. That being said there are still group projects and if you meet up with your group a decent amount you can get a decent grade, And this is unethical but you don’t actually have to put in any work. But if you do show up your partners will acknowledge you and the “work/effort” you’ve put inThis is very true. If you’re so tired that it’s hard to concentrate on a conversation, then you will come across as aloof. I also agree that the religious groups on campus are welcoming no matter what religion you are, and you don’t have to join the religion in order to be a part of the social activities.

I know that you\\'re asking for jacket suggestions, but since it\\'s your first USA winter, I have additional advice that may come in handy.  If you plan on traveling outside of city limits, there are additional things I would tell you about, but for now I\\'m assuming you\\'re not leaving civilization.\\n\\n1. If you plan on going out in the snow for an extended period of time (it\\'s your first USA winter - you may want to build a snowman), a second pair of gloves can be a wonderful investment.  Gloves get wet and take time to dry.  I usually have one pair of really good, heavy gloves that I keep in my coat pockets, but then I have a pair of super cheap, thin gloves that I roll up and keep in my bookbag in case my main pair gets wet.\\n2. If you\\'re planning on riding a bicycle in the winter, invest in a balaclava.  The wind on a cold day can be miserable when you\\'re on a bike if you don\\'t dress for it.  Also be aware that riding on ice and snow is a serious hazard even to those of us who have experience riding on it.

Not to say that there aren\\'t better ways to do it than others, but that I don\\'t think there\\'s a one-size-fits all.  As others have said, I\\'d advise against using the paper invitation (it just won\\'t come across as very socially-savvy, which probably increases perceived creepiness), and go with whatever seems to work the most often, and just try to appear nonthreatening and stuff.  I literally don\\'t go to bars though, so take whatever I say with a grain of salt.Higher education is mostly filled with people leaning left, so you are probably better off looking somewhere else.

I had really poor numbers in high school but got into Astronomy as my back up and transferring to CS + Astro was super easy (aside from fighting every semester for a seat in major CS classes). If you’re really passionate about your +X I would apply to CS + X to begin with, but if you’re only thinking about CS + X because admission might be easier, just go for plain CS if it’s what you really want!!! I believe in you and think you will get admitted for your second choice at LEAST. So pick your true passion for your first choice because you’ll never know if you don’t try!![deleted][removed]Anonymouses are what we call ourselves to outsiders. I am taking CS class, and I have a special water resistant suit.Hell yeah brother, cheers from Iraq!Thanks! Do you if it is easy to get a single in the dorms?Part of it might be the Gingko trees; the female trees produce a fruit that smells really bad. There are lots of them along Lincoln by vet med. There are also two massive ginkgoes outside of Noyes, but I’m not sure if they’re male or female. Try to avoid walking on the fruits because the smell will stick to your shoes. And don’t touch them, they contain the same toxin as poison ivy.Try and watch youtube videos on the subject before the semester. You don\\'t have to get into too much detail. It\\'d be nice to have some background knowledge.I see that I misunderstood your previous comment about squids. However I am still curious about what level of risk are you willing to accept. Also, I am interested in your reasons for why seatbelt laws are necessary but helmet laws aren\\'t, because both of these devices only protect the users, not \"others\".That was an extremely thoughtful response I could not agree more with!!!What’s the point of bars that are 18?? Lol Yeah but they’re super easy. They pretty much give you most of the material you need to studyThey are using the textbook. Everything they teach follows Patt &amp; Patel and if you don\\'t understand it they literally give you three other textbooks to read from.

[deleted]I\\'m a former RA, just graduated last semester, so feel free to ask me if you have any questions.\\n\\nWhole RA experience was very positive, my team/co-workers were great, you get out of it what you put into it. There were times of added stress, but it was largely a fairly laid-back experience.You don\\'t spend as much time learning :)Neat! Best of luck, fam.In the view of ML:\\n\\nMath 484 is relevant for covering basic optimization methods, cost functions, and constraints. \\n\\nSTAT 410 is relevant for covering tuning parameters, feature transformations, and distributions. \\n\\nBetween those two, I\\'d say Math 484: Half of STAT 410 like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and other tests aren\\'t usually covered in introductory ML. If you want a statistical perspective of ML, then take Stat 425/429/542. Almost everything covered in Math 484 intersects with ML. \\n\\nWhichever course you choose, know that while both should make you better understand ML topics, both aren\\'t going to make you do ML any easier or better. Why Coursicle? Course Explorer does the same notifications for freeStepanov for statistics classes like 400 or 420 (more advanced classes would not be a good idea for your last semester lol) No flamerino but get into CS + econ before bothering to plan out all 4 years.

The course will always be \"pending\" and will have 0 seats if you look it up in Enterprise.Honestly, I loved UIUC and the CS program is great, but if you\\'re already a student at the University of Toronto it\\'s not like it\\'s a huge step up to switch institutions, basically regardless of where you\\'re switching to. If you hustle, work hard, and find like-minded peers or drastically different people to challenge, I\\'m sure you\\'ll be able to find success there. The University of Toronto has a great program, and cost comparison is definitely an issue to keep in mind, even if you personally aren\\'t paying for it. 85k is a ton. UIUC definitely has a startup hub, a great alumni network, etc.\\n\\nAre you truly unhappy there, or is this a more general fit of malaise/regretted decisions? Will transferring actually make you happier? What did you find wrong/misleading about research the the University of Toronto? Only you can answer that.I don\\'t know if that\\'s the case for getting a license if you\\'ve never had one. I think that\\'s probably true. I only got a temporary license when I turned 21, and they punched a hole in my old license (I would show both old and temporary license as ID).I got one around 11pm yesterday Relying on your brother and girlfriend for heavy emotional support is a huge mental toll, that\\'s why you go to a therapist, so it doesn\\'t become a burden for them. Maybe you don\\'t need traditional talk therapy. As someone with chronic depression like yourself, mine went into remission when I went away from talk therapy and went into dialectic based therapy. This type of therapy relies less upon the day to day and more upon changing the mind altogether, which sounds kind of hippy-esque, but it is a very legitimate therapeutic field derived from cognitive based therapy. Near campus there is a relatively inexpensive group DBT program for adults that does 9 week sessions, look up Elliott Counseling.������������Yeah bro I agree. There is no displacement along x and y and there is no force along z. There is no way for it to be doing work.I did CS 418,440,498 VR. I also did a couple weeks of ML. \\n\\nCs 418 I must have taken 2 years ago. It was ok. Funny enough its one of those classes where the conceps helped but the applications didn’t. It was writing some WebGL code and nobody in the web dev industry really uses it. Most libraries can accomplish whatever you want in a shorter period of time/easier. \\n\\nCS 440 I took 1 yr ago. It was dope. One of my favorite classes at uiuc.\\n\\nCS 498 VR was 1.5 yr ago when Steve Lavelle was still with the university (he went to Norway I believe). It was easyish and somewhat interesting. Useful if you like robotics since VR is kind of high level robotics. \\n\\nCS 446 was 6 months ago. Was stupidly hard. If you had a group of friends the class was 100x times easier. But by yourself it was just stupid. I dropped just because I just wanted to do ML not do grad school for it.CompE\\'s absolutely do not have to take the hard EE courses lmao 340 makes 210/310 look like a walk in the park, and there are plenty of harder electives. Thanks for tagging me! As others have said, it never hurts to dress nicely and have your résumé on hand in case they ask. Other than that, don’t worry too much! This is just a chance for the grad student to get to know you. They probably won’t ask you anything too crazy, but be prepared to explain:\\n\\nWhy you want to get involved with research\\n\\nWhy this specifically lab is interesting to you \\n\\nHow researching will help you reach your career goals \\n\\nIt’s also a good idea to know what you’ll say when they inevitably ask you to tell them about yourself and name your biggest strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nGOOD LUCK EVERYONE!lol what.

You guys see anything particularly fun? Should I be selecting courses already? I\\'m new here. Also, none of the classes I looked at have instructors listed yet. Many only have one or two classes as well. Is that normal?\\n\\nIt looks like there are only two partial differential equations classes. Ones an intro and ones only for grad students?

Since you\\'re not playing games, more cores is generally better. .) \\n\\ni7 has will have hyperthreading, which is generally overkill for gaming but a decent boost for other applications.

They\\'re great for battery, and bad for heavy lifting.\\n\\n\\n(possibly) 16gb of RAM. This really depends on whether or not your simulations will be big enough to break 8gb. RAM is fairly cheap, so manufacturers often stuff in an extra 8gb to inflate specs.\\n\\nGPU - obviously these are primarily for gaming, HOWEVER, if anything you\\'re using mentions CUDA or OpenCL support, a discrete GPU will provide massive benefits.So first 10 people each get a dollar?

I thought this would be a good place to ask since here are the students.  Why google when real people are here?  From the responses so far international students are here because they can and because they think it is a good education.  That still begs the original question.  Aren\\'t there universities just as good in your home country?  Or are you saying UIUC and other universities in the USA are better and so much better that would travel around the world for that?  Another possibility is that schools in home countries are just as good but students who travel here were not accepted but had the money to travel here.  I have heard the business climate here is better.  Are there no decent schools of higher education for the same subject area in other countries?  UIUC is really among the best not just in the USA but in the world?  If that is true then what have other countries been doing for the last hundred years or so?  Why the discrepancy?  Considering the amount of money international students bring to the university why wouldn\\'t someone pool that together to create their own university in another place?  Same standards.

Then, move-in with a roommate agreement template. UC San Diego has a [roommate agreement Word document template](https://students.ucsd.edu/_files/sls/SLS-roommate-agreement-2011.doc), searchable online too \"roommate agreement template\".\\n\\nFirst, check your lease for any language which puts you at-risk for penalties.\\nThen, schedule a private meeting with your property manager or landlord. Get their opinion. Stress that you are trying your best to be faithful to the lease agreement.\\n(Sometimes, property managers and landlords give decent advice--but they probably don\\'t want to be personally involved--unless the lease agreement is being broken.)\\nThen, come up with a plan.\\n\\nMake sure that you inform the roommate in writing, preferably email, so you have documentation which you can refer to later with property management (or a court if it gets ugly).\\n\\nJust write something like \"hey, Joey, the apartment is getting really dirty, and I\\'m worried about our landlord flipping-out when they start showing units for fall rentals. According to the lease, it says \"...\". I don\\'t want us to lose our deposit.\" (Make sure that your message is informative but there is no tone--angry, joking, or otherwise. You don\\'t want to trigger something.) Then, depending on his response, insist that all roommates should sit-down and sign a roommate agreement, \"to make sure that nobody is cleaning up after someone else\".\\n\\nSo, you can inform the property management to get an ally (and more ideas), and you can try the diplomatic approach with a roommate agreement to designate who does what. (Make sure to keep a scanned copy on your computer--in case the original disappears).\\n\\nGood luck. That situation sucks so bad.Look into seeing the counseling center, they know about a lot of resources on campus that you could use and they could be someone for you to just talk to :)This is so UIUC hahahaLameI took calc 3 through netmath over the summer this year. It was insanely hard. The calculus taught in calc 3 is not that hard but to get an A in the class you need much more than a solid grasp of calc 3. \\n\\nThe class was taught with Mathable. If you have experience with Wolfram\\'s Mathematica or any coding experience at all you are already at a pretty sizable advantage, although in terms of difficulty the syntax is not hard and it is well documented, it definitely helps to not need to focus on the code as much and focus on completing the assignments.\\n\\nHomework is a whopping 50% and this is for sure the hardest part of the class. We get 2-3 assignments each week and each took me anywhere from 4-14 hours, with the average sitting around 12 hours. So you\\'d be looking at the equivalent of a full time job. \\n\\nThe exams are not that bad. Because this class forces you to do all the homework, you have a pretty solid grasp of most calculus needed for the exam. The reviews and study material given to you are solid and I definitely recommend doing them.\\n\\nLastly, I seriously doubt I would have gotten a good grade if it wasn\\'t for a groupme that was formed at the beginning of the class (shoutout to those people if you\\'re reading this). Unlike a traditional classroom course, you don\\'t get to make study buddies from lecture or discussion. The fact that someone came up with an idea to band a big group of people together to tackle the class definitely saved a lot of people\\'s asses. \\n\\nA little sidenote about the course organization. I, and a lot of others, hated it. Many people complained about the TA\\'s being unhelpful or outright refusing to answer questions. For example, there were many many posts made asking about a curve, but all get taken down by the TAs except for a handful where they definitively denied the possibility of a curve.

[deleted]I\\'m a current RA right now and technically you still can get a job while being employed by housing. Just remember that the position counts as a 20 hour week job. The experience as an RA is actually pretty good, it mainly depends on your own floor culture. It could be really fun if you like planning events and your floor is social or it could be annoying if your floor just wants to live there and do nothing else. The benefits are pretty good with free housing and meal plan, a single room, and a small stipend. Don\\'t do it if you want to make money cause you won\\'t make a lot lol. If you have any questions feel free to pm me.I mean it\\'s up to you, you\\'re mostly taking classes which explore the field in general (and extracurricular stuff is where you get your hands dirty)\\n\\nThere\\'s plenty of clubs/ RSOs that explore robotics, literally anything you can think of.Btw, the link in your post isn\\'t linked \\n\\nAnd paging u/cumtd to check the signs \\n\\nmeh it\\'s not the end of the world. you have the rest of your life to enjoy shitty dive bars and it gets old trust me.

Think back to those rsos on quad day that you never really considered going to even though you signed up for an email or whatever and maybe give one of those a try.

The 24 hour phone line was really helpful, they gave me directions and told the driver to wait for me. \\n\\nUsually they run a tight schedule (usually on time) which means far less delays compared to Amtrak/Greyhound. Peoria Charter has the most buses going to and from Chicagoland area daily which can give you more flexibility in your schedule.

However, it is possible, it WILL get better. While I dont exactly have the best studying habits either, every person has a different learning style. For me, I try to understand and learn as I go in class. If I dont, I go to office hours or at least memorize the information for exams. If you really want to change your study style, do it. Take small steps if necessary. Study a few days ahead, or even a little bit each day. Think about whether you really understand the material in class when you do the practice exams, like why did I chose this answer...\\n\\nRegarding how you hold yourself and your situation.... focus on yourself and improving. Life can be really difficult and an arse, and when we become used to one route, in which we dont view things as bright anymore, it can be difficult to pull out of that mentality.

Honestly though, I suggest making an appointment with the counseling center for support and options to improve.

It\\'s hard for me to approach people I do not know, and at times it\\'s even hard for me to approach people I do know.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you are like me and can not approach people, you might want to talk to your doctor, especially if you have a gatekeeper insurance policy (ie one in which you have to get a referral to see any kind of specialist).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you can approach people, a next step would be to think about what contexts you can/should approach people. You obviously do not want to approach someone who looks busy (e.g. reading a book at the library) or in a place where socializing would be inappropriate (e.g. their workplace) or difficult (e.g. due to noise).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOnce you pick the person you want to approach and you\\'re sure there are no evident signs that you shouldn\\'t approach the person, you can think about how to approach them (e.g. what to say). People like to talk about themselves, so I recommend asking a question about some non-sensitive aspect of themselves. If you\\'re at an RSO event, that means they chose to attend the event so you can probably guess at least one of that person\\'s interests. You might ask how long they have been in the club or how they heard about it, or a more specific question about that interested like, \"How long have you been playing Chess?\" if it\\'s a chess club.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFinally, don\\'t give \\'short\\' responses and do recognize when the other person is giving you \\'short\\' responses. If someone says, \"This is my first time at Chess club. I\\'m so excited to start playing. How about you?\"  You shouldn\\'t say \"Same\" and you might want to say \"It\\'s my first time too! I heard about it on Reddit. How did you hear about it?\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, these are some things I would try if I wasn\\'t so shy. Good luck!When they start moving to pet your dog, tell them the dog has worms.  When they stop and look at you tell them you have worms too.In Spring 2019, no.

While he never wore a suit, life with him was difficult as he would frequently be making noises to his dragon lover until 3 am (yes I have heard dragon phone sex). Honestly, the better option is to put your foot down now and ask politely to not wear his fursuit when friends are over. Say that he can have his fursuit friends when you are there. You should try to avoid it somewhat to prevent escalation. But honestly it is better to establish the ground rules now.Yo Why does it matter? There are worse things someone could wear or do.

But If you ever encounter a problem then they are horrible to deal with. They just do everything backwards and are insanely unorganized. Not in the slightest.

The sad but true reality of 202: if you don’t have significant experience in chemistry (e.g., a 5 on the AP exam), it’s tough to come out of 202 with an A. That does not, however, mean you can’t learn a ton and still succeed in the chemistry/chem e program. I don\\'t feel that I have enough information to make a useful phone call.

The entire class is basically learning problem solving; watching the videos and reading the textbook might help but you\\'re only going to benefit from actually doing problems.\\n\\nYou just took a practice exam (who cares if you did bad on a practice midterm? no one will ever know), so you should curate all the problems you got wrong, try them again, and bring the ones you still don\\'t get to your TA/Decoste\\'s office hours. \\n\\n202 is a ridiculously hard class and you\\'re doing better than you think. Good luck!Yeah, I highly doubt OP later went to shoot up drugs with the homeless manTbh I agree that PHYS 211 lectures are kinda useless. The only reason to go is for the participation points which is kinda annoying, although the demos can sometimes be fun/useful. I\\'m not in ECE but for 211, I never actually do the HW or pay attention in lecture I just go over as many practice tests as possible. The practice tests on Flipitphysics that have worked out solutions for every problem are a lifesaver. However, lectures being somewhat useless is definitely not the case for every college course, especially as you progress through your curriculumThe total compensation package is valued at ~$13,000. **If** we worked 20 hours/week (which we don\\'t), that\\'d still come out to more than $20/hour.My mom says I\\'m interesting.

Dionysus (or Dionysos; also known as Bacchus in Roman mythology and associated with the Italic Liber), the Thracian god of wine, represents not only the intoxicating power of wine, but also its social and beneficent influences. He is viewed as the promoter of civilization, a lawgiver, and lover of peace — as well as the patron deity of both agriculture and the theater.\\n\\n***\\n\\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/UIUC/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28This sounds like fun but I play piano, not a very band-friendly instrument.[deleted]M8 this was before he/she found out that the noise was due to formula SAEIt\\'s a student run organization!

They are not going to want to accept a student who might also find their campus not a good match as well. So you will need to be convincing academically and with regard to your research on why you you think a transfer there will be a better match for your needs.\\n\\nSo be sure to understand why this campus is not a good fit (it happens - so don\\'t feel bad if it does not fit your needs) and understand what a new campus needs to look and feel like.

Yeah, it is shitty if the professor says the exams are noncumulative but then includes trivial details from prior exams. The blame is 100% on them in that case. However, the unfortunate aspect of chemistry is that some concepts do build on themselves, just like concepts in math and physics do. The good news is that once in med school the small details from college tend to matter less and less yet the big concepts remain important. I don\\'t know if your questions involving exam 1 material were big concepts or not but just know that a lot of those concepts aren\\'t going anywhere.\\n\\n\"not did you learn the material the professor quickly spewed in lecture\"\\n\\nThis is so true. If test averages are in the 50s then the professor is either writing a test that is beyond the difficulty level of the class or they are being a shitty teacher. The truth is that there are a lot of really intelligent professors out there. Unfortunately that doesn\\'t mean they are great educators. I\\'ve even run into this with some of my medical school\\'s professors. They are experts in their field but they don\\'t understand just how little I know about the topic of discussion, and so they don\\'t really know where to begin. In a sense, they are so familiar with this topic that they have a difficult time \"dumbing it down\" for a student to learn for the first time. They really don\\'t know how much is review/obvious or how much is new material.They eat in Iken before each gameThere is a parking lot on the east side of the tracks across from the station for Amtrak.

And the tests were based on classroom discussion, so as long as you participate and write down the class notes you were set.

Use your desire to be sneaky in a positive light :)snitchThat\\'s the attitude I wanted to do something similar to that but I wasn\\'t confident that I would be able to find someone to sublease for the second semester and then I would get stuck with a $4000 bill just for time that I am not living there. Are there a lot of people who are trying to sublease for only Spring?The veorides won\\'t be doing so well anyway. Constantly being out in the cold won\\'t be good for them. Depends on how wild the weekend shows at Canopy Club get, surely.\\nPhys major/CS minor\\n\\nCS 498 RK, PHYS 326, PHYS 435, MATH 415 + research/work - any thoughts? Current is CS 173 (Warnow), CS 225, PHYS 325, PHYS 402 + research/work and that\\'s been pretty challenging/time consuming so I was hoping that might be (slightly) easier.I do a lot of electronic side projects and repairs for pocket change. I go online shopping for actual electronic components. \\n\\nYou can requisition parts online from manufacturers for dirt cheap.\\n\\nAs for tools, I think the ECEB has a shop you get access to after completing some safety course thing.  (If anybody has more info on this please let me know as well because I\\'m super interested.)for Buckley, attendance is not mandatory all, and his slides are online. There\\'s packback once a week and most homework is only due the day of the midterm. All three midterms are optional and the weight shifts to the final if you don\\'t take them. So very flexible, I couldn\\'t say with certainty that he\\'s more easy.Hopefully the other students will follow up with pointers on good local counseling.     It\\'s good to talk to some combination of your advisor, dean of students office, and/or DRES so that officialdom knows there\\'s a reason behind your gpa.    If you connect with a good counselor, they can help with getting you accommodations such as a light load.\\n\\nTry to make time to get this sorted out.    If it looks like you need a light load or a term off, do that and don\\'t even consider feeling guilty.    Any sort of serious problem does eat up working time.    \\n\\nDon\\'t feel you have to completely make up early bad grades.   Employers or grad school will care most about how you did in later courses, esp. in your main area of interest.     Some people with stunningly bad early gpa have gone on to become faculty.\\n\\nWhen you get some free time (e.g. over break), think about what you do and don\\'t like doing, e.g. do you want to be in CE.    Depression can make it hard to succeed even when you\\'re in the right major.    But being in the wrong major can feed depression.    Keep an open mind about which it is, and try to tune your academic schedule towards topics you enjoy (within and/or outside CE).\\n\\nAlso try to identify some activity to do outside your major, e.g. exercise, RSO.    Even just get outside to take walks in the sun.    No one thrives if they are cooped up in ECEB or Siebel 24/7.I go there a lot.  You\\'re right that it takes extra attention and proactive and early reading of intentions.  I look at it as the training roundabout, so that eventually this safer and more efficient concept can be slowly moved into adoption.  I go into each approach to the roundabout with the mindset of possibly educating the other drivers by my actions.\\n\\nI\\'m glad it\\'s there, and I\\'m glad there\\'s only one of them right now.We are with you, bro. Just keep moving on, doing what you can everyday.It\\'s been tried a few times.  The last one went out of business about 5 years ago.  I was in your position, and strongly considered it but decided to stay because so much money had already been spent on me as an oos student. I still dislike the school, 2.5 years later, but now I\\'m just used to the feeling and looking forward to getting out of here. Hang on if you can, but if you\\'re really not into the school then talk to an advisor and find another place. I mean it sounded like a stupid accident. Not like he just had the urge to set someone on fire.Personal projects are a fun way to get better at coding.Yes.

They are expensive to build and maintain over time. UIUC basically makes parking lots where there used to be houses or other buildings until such time as the space is needed for academic or related buildings. Building a multi level parking structure makes that a costly expansion method.\\n\\nThere are multi level lots on University, Gregory, Daniel Street, and John Street.  There is no real-world scenario where you should need to implement a DP solution in 45 minutes. Also, rushing to implement a solution teaches developers bad habits about automated testing and readable code.\"Very few people actually die during pledging\" is the exact shit that is wrong with Greek life.

I would lowball it at 3-4 hours all together, though.[https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/9lhjwu/this\\\\_wouldve\\\\_been\\\\_consequential\\\\_for\\\\_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/9lhjwu/this_wouldve_been_consequential_for_us/)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSome similar discussion, if anyone\\'s interestedNo, the SEVIS system is meant to be a *real-time* snapshot of a student\\'s academic history in the US and ISSS is required by law to update it whenever an International student makes any change to their course load. They report the academic status for a *new* semester on the 10th day, but changes after that have to be reported too. Furthermore, maintaining status is the student\\'s responsibility. This means that even if there is a delay between when the student goes below the minimum and when ISSS reports it, the student goes out of status from the second they lowered their credit hours and are effectively in the country illegally from that moment on. That can invite a 10-year ban on future visas to the US.\\n\\nHowever, ISSS can permit the student to go below the minimum load once during the program for a variety of reasons, one of which is misplacement in a course i.e., the student isn\\'t ready to take that course and signed up erroneously. But ISSS approval is required before they actually drop the course. From my understanding though, it can only be done once during the program, and most students use it in their last semester when they need to take just one class to graduate.Sign Me up!!!!! Yes.

Kudeki\\'s been posting about it in the ECE Piazza\\n\\n&gt; NOTICE of PREREQUISITE ENFORCEMENTS:\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt; In order to ensure that you are prepared to succeed in your courses, prerequisites and concurrent registration requirements will begin to be enforced for College of Engineering courses through the Enterprise/Self Service System in addition to checks that your department conducts. Please note that this falls within the boundaries of the Student Code. Enforcement will start for a few courses offered in Spring 2019 with additional courses phased in across the College over the next few semesters. We encourage you to work with your academic advisor to plan accordingly.\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt; Attempts to register for courses without having met prerequisites will yield the following message:\\n\\n&gt; “Course Prerequisite and/or Test Score Error –Contact Course Department”\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt; If you receive this message, first check Course Explorer (https://courses.illinois.edu/) to ensure you have satisfied the prerequisite(s) for taking the course. If you have satisfied the prerequisite(s), please complete the online form (https://go.engineering.illinois.edu/Prerequisite) to request an override. If you have not taken the prerequisite course(s), please contact your academic advisor in your home department to discuss an academic plan that will satisfy the prerequisite(s) in the upcoming semester.\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt; Finally, please note that if you are taking a course this semester, which is a prerequisite for a course you plan to take next semester, you will be allowed to register for that course. However, if you do not pass the prerequisite course this semester, you will be removed from the course in which you do not meet the prerequisites prior to the start of the semester. In the event you are removed from a prerequisite course, it is your responsibility to adjust your semester accordingly within the 10-day add-drop period at the beginning of the term, while maintaining at least 12 credit hours.\\n\\n \\n\\n&gt; Additional details available here:  https://go.engineering.illinois.edu/PrerequisiteWIKI  The counseling center is always a good place when you got something on your mind.

The man was Hispanic, and Madigan’s district is highly Hispanic, so the man though he’d have a chance. To counter this, Madigan directed two men with Hispanic-sounding last names to also enter the race. What had been previously an uncontested race was now a 4-way race. The catch was that Madigan’s plants didn’t run campaigns. Their campaign HQs were residential addresses and no one ever saw their face.

Two main reasons - you see how several are following a similar pattern - that is because the aircraft are following a standard air traffic control vectors. These are roughly highways in the sky which allows pilots and controllers to know where aircraft are.  So those lines are likely from from aircraft at cruising altitude (roughly 30,000-42,000) for longer flights across the US.  There are several due to aircraft passing through a similar space with some miles between them fore and aft. The wind then displaces the contrails as the next plane come along.\\n\\nSecond, contrails form at higher elevations due to temperature, pressure and exhaust from aircraft. These factors tend to align at these higher elevations.  For sure, but I\\'d be willing to bet the professor didn\\'t think about this.Greyhound is shit, take Amtrak instead if you canProbably around 40 - 50 % I guess. nice :)If you can find someone over 25 to help, Enterprise rents the giant 20 person vans out at a reasonable rate.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t, a charter bus is probably still cheaper than trying to zipcar everyone - though not by a lot.Spec chem: not at all\\n\\nChem S&amp;L (if you have to add other classes and maintain a very good GPA for grad school): not at all\\n\\nChem S&amp;L (if you don\\'t have to do that stuff): kindaLmao you went to the police and turned yourself in for vandalizing private property but you\\'re still claiming all you did was gently pick up a sprinkler off the sidewalk and place it in the driveway?

My advice is don’t just sit back and let your partner do the whole lab; you have to take ownership of your understanding and slowly walk through as much code as you need to to fully grasp what’s happening.  A lot of the homework problems are from a textbook (A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python, Langtangen) with a lot of fantastic example problems for you to work through if you need to build your coding intuition from the ground up. Coding is possible for everyone, but it’s okay to not be good at it at first. I believe in you!!!

In that case, I might just talk to the therapist and see if things can get better. \\n\\nWhat\\'s your major tho? Is it the course structure of that particular course that bugs you? Or do you just not like all of them? If it\\'s just one particular course, can you postpone that course for a later semester/different instructor?  I am from ECE and based on my personal experience, the dynamic of the course can change a lot from semester to semester and from instructor to instructor. \\n\\nAnd maybe you could also talk with the advising office from your department. Usually they can help you come up with something. I almost got on academic probation last semester. I talked to the advising office at the beginning of this semester. And it turned out that had I talked with them last semester, there would be some steps I could try to get a better-looking transcript. Also, transferring major is still an option. I have friends transferring to LAS from ECE in junior year. I myself have also thought about transferring major before. \\n\\nI really hope you  get through this. Don\\'t give up. I want to piggyback onto the top post so this gets some visibility - as of 10/23 12:51pm, Kudeki is saying that there will be overrides for \"strong\" students finishing ECE 220 this semester.

I would optimistically imagine that the situation is going to get better for those who would be most immediately impacted.**Simulated annealing**\\n\\nSimulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem.  It is often used when the search space is discrete (e.g., all tours that visit a given set of cities).  For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to alternatives such as gradient descent.\\n\\n***\\n\\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/UIUC/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28It\\'s to my apartment.

However, I will encourage you and others in this thread to continue asking for help on the forum and in office hours.\\n\\nCompared to your private chat the forum has several advantages:\\n\\n* A lot of questions have already been answered. Finding an answer can require a bit of browsing and digging, but that\\'s not dissimilar from finding answers to any questions online.\\n* There\\'s a really large, active, and knowledgable community of staff and students on the forum, ready to help out pretty much at all hours. We\\'ve also been encouraging students to message their code to the course staff if they need help with specific bits, and we\\'ve read a lot of code that way this semester.\\n* Finally, as Kyle mentioned, it\\'s easier for us to keep an eye on the discussion on the forum to make sure that it doesn\\'t cross the line into inappropriate collaboration. That doesn\\'t sound like a problem here, but please be very careful about how you communicate about the MP.\\n\\n&gt; However, I feel like everyone around me is so much smarter than I am so they wouldn\\'t want to work with someone who has no idea what they are doing.\\n\\nThis is a common experience for beginners in any field, and computer science is no exception. All I can say in response is everyone else is _not_ so much smarter than you, and they would probably love to work with someone who is honest about what they know and don\\'t know rather than a know-it-all that turns out to know rather less than it all.\\n\\nIf you have feedback about how we can improve our course resources, or make the course more welcoming to students like you, I\\'d love to hear it. Stop by and introduce yourself sometime, or we have an [online anonymous feedback form](https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/feedback/) that you can use. Good luck on MP3!ECE 110 is one of those classes that comes together towards the end of the semester and it all makes a lot more sense. At least that\\'s how I felt.

Feel free to PM me if you have more questions, but if you really feel like you don\\'t like the major you should talk to you advisor and consider a transfer to a different one.Jesus loves youSo the correct solution, is to punch someone?Okay, Dennis~~Free Printing~~In order to die, you have to be alive in the first place.Invite him over to my apartment for soup.Have you taken the ACT multiple times?

I think college isn\\'t about absolute knowledge at all but about developing a mature style of problem solving/reasoning/learning in general. So spacing your education out and being exposed to multiple approaches to thinking by being around smart people (or just having the freedom to develop your own) for four years is very valuable and more important than any actual material that\\'s covered or measured by tests/grades etc. I think that\\'s especially important for people that want to do research and for those that want a job as quickly as possible I think it gives them a few years to think about learning rather than just focussing on getting things done. Of course, you can get a whole lot done by just knowing a bunch of stuff but that\\'s really not very satisfying at least to me.\\n\\nEdit: when i think about it this mostly applies to fields that are math heavyNo they have not. They banned “hostile or abusive” Native American mascots. \\n\\nThe university needs to get support of the tribe or group. Illinois has kept the nickname Illini, but not the chief. Florida State has support of both the mascot and the nickname. There is an issue that the Illini are not one tribe, but the largest remaining tribe is the Peoria tribe, so the NCAA would likely accept any agreement.you are assuming that college student can think rationallyWhy must you get a degree or go to grad school? Doesn\\'t sound like you\\'re in it for the right reasons if you feel like you HAVE to do that to be comparable to other people. Do you HAVE to make $100k+ a year or would you be fine with $60k-70k a year with some other degree or vocational school? It is not worth taking your life over school. You will be okay either way. Just relax, try to cross suicide out of the equation, and look rationally at what exactly happened and how you can fix it. Talk to people, to a professor, TA, someone to get some guidance on how you can recover.. I used to have a sub-3.0 GPA when I first transferred here. I was soo depressed and felt worthless. I thought I\\'d never get to grad school. I just worked harder, paid more attention to homework solutions, asked more questions and pulled my GPA above 3.0, got an internship, etc. Granted, I didn\\'t apply and don\\'t think I would get into grad school here, but I got accepted elsewhere, which is still a good school. In conclusion, don\\'t let school control your life in such a way that you want to commit suicide. Trust me, I know it takes up a lot of your time (ECE boi here) but try to spend some mandatory time on your hobbies, balance out the stress with fun, as cliche as it sounds it actually really helps.Your problematic fav is still flexin Ayyye how we doing this!?Bring back the Chief and let the haters leave. \\n\\nThe NCAA should not have the power to regulate mascots because universities have no viable alternative to the NCAA.

CPSC major here looking for a good Non-western culturesuh dudePulled a sneaky on yaWhat\\'s a good Gen Ed course that fulfills the US Minorities requirement? I\\'m looking for a relatively easy A class.The Uber driver I’m guessing doesn’t have a record since he is able to drive for the company. So that same man would be able to conceal and carry and could have made this situation extremely worse. If you want to add more guns for the good guys, you will also undoubtedly add more guns to the wrong pplThank you! Yeah, he loves exploring so he’s out as much as he can be. We’ve got his bed and toys on the porch. I’m going to put his litter box out when I get home today as well. Feel free to correct me if I’m wrong. Post a link to the comment, and that\\'s undeniable proof. got cut out bc we started lab 2 weeks late bc of construction in the chem annex[deleted]I took this class last year and did mediocre on the first two exams (Cs on both), and then got As on the 3rd exam and final and got an A in the class. For the 3rd exam, I started reading the book and taking notes on it, actually did the hw, and paid attention in lecture. Reading the book and taking notes on it probably helped me the most. Definitely go to office hours too. If Clegg/TAs still have exam review sessions, go to those too. Does Clegg still have the resurrection policy? From what I remember, the final was pretty easy. If there\\'s still extra credit take advantage of that tooYou need the most contributions in your class to impress the ladiesNo, there\\'s a new manager nowFrom my understanding, it’s kind of difficult, but doable if it’s something you’re really committed to[deleted][deleted][deleted]Just place them in a large body of waterHeard Over The Rainbow, it was great! Do you guys choose the songs based on the bells available?Work on getting up at the same time every day. Even if you don\\'t always sleep at exactly the same time (but make an effort to do that too). If you have an alarm go off at the same time every day and you do your best to get out of bed, it will get much easier after about a week. That\\'s why high school was easy - you were on a regular schedule.Thanks, I\\'ll look into that this weekI am talking about people talking in silent floors! Not only talking with each other but also talking on the phone!It\\'s a little slower than that. The first step was introducing 126 for new students, next they\\'ll modify 225, and finally they\\'ll discontinue 242. Eventually 126 will be a transfer req.Nah we getting another Wendy\\'s You could also just move to another room/dorm within university housingI can tell you why, Madigan is on a first name basis with his constituency. Like literally he knows most of his voters names. He does a lot of favors for them, gets them jobs, funding, whatever they need. They in turn appreciate having a representative with so much power and influence. \\n\\nA few years back someone dared to run against Madigan. The man was Hispanic, and Madigan’s district is highly Hispanic, so the man though he’d have a chance. To counter this, Madigan directed two men with Hispanic-sounding last names to also enter the race. What had been previously an uncontested race was now a 4-way race. The catch was that Madigan’s plants didn’t run campaigns. Their campaign HQs were residential addresses and no one ever saw their face. It became obvious they were there to split the Hispanic vote and ensure Madigan emerged on top. That’s the kind of guy Madigan is. Literally completely wrong. Unless you think leetcode hards/  DP problems are common knowledge lolUhh are these sanctions new? They definitely weren’t a thing when I or anyone I knew got drinking tickets. You pay the ticket and are good to go.lol what is this really a thingRIP.You can totally do both, and it will put you pretty ahead of schedule which is nice.  Me and a bunch of my friends did that, its kinda hard, but totally doable and I thought totally worth it.  Then you only have to worry about combos of 422/424/440 too which is nice.Wait, I misread some stuff.\\n\\nWhen it goes through the all pairs shortest paths restricting computation to nodes below a certain threshold, is the way it works that it\\'s trying to minimize the amount of time taken be staying away from nodes that would require extra computational time to go through?\\n\\nMy interpretation of things is that \"regret\" here would apply as the algorithm\\'s mechanism for discarding nodes that are unlikely to appear on the shortest directed cycle. It looks at each option with a heuristic that will reveal if the node has no chance to appear on the shortest directed cycle - whether or not the algorithm would regret wasting the computational time on that node - and then only performs calculations where the cycle in question is capable of being found. Am I still full of shit?I am pretty sure County Market sells themNot to be rude, but there\\'s always going to be people that do better than you and people that do worse than you. Some of it might be due to prior knowledge, but some of it is due to hard work. It\\'s up to you to improve yourself. If you just sit there and bemoan your lack of previous physics experience, you\\'re not going to get any better at it. Go to office hours, actually do the prelectures instead of skipping through it, understand the homework instead of using Chegg. It\\'s very possible for you to do above average without taking AP Physics E&amp;M.FAfter polling KFT, Latea, Cafe Bene, Teamoji, and Hammerhead Coffee, the place with the cheapest price is Hammerhead Coffee at 3.01. (incl tax)\\n\\nThat being said, their bubble tea is made of tea and milk instead of tea and milk powder, with literally no sugar. It’s cheap, it’s bubbles, but it’s not “bubble tea.” Owner’s super chill tho.\\n\\nPast Hammerhead, KFT slides in below the rest at 5.18$, but everything else is at max .30 more, but KFT has the most reasonable reward plan.\\n\\nI haven’t been to Cocomero, the place next to McDonalds, so those could be cheaper.\\n\\nIn conclusion, shits hella expensive.\\n\\nEdit: Cocomero comes in at the same price as KFT.Yeah Red Lion is safe I think the average my junior year on the first exam was something like a 50%. Brutal class.This is why r/UIUC best in classI hear he doesn\\'t take my insurance. Not sure what you mean exactly?\\n\\nAre you talking about just getting a job and living as opposed to becoming famous in your field?\\n\\nMost people really just want a steady life and career if that is what you\\'re saying. \\n\\nPersonally I\\'m incapable of either'"

# University-mental-health-analysis

This is the topic that my teammate and I decided to cope with in the <a href = https://datathon.stanford.edu/>Stanford Open Datathon Project</a>.

The question statement was to develop a statistical model analyzing any topic related to your university. My teammate suggested a very interesting topic about analyzing the mental health of college students through checking their social media activities.
